title: Pylons vs Django

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/11/pylons-vs-django.html)_.

I like the interior workings of Pylons, I really do. But if I want to do SQL based crud apps then Django is simply stronger. That strength is what drew me to TurboGears for a bit before parts of TurboGears annoyed me. Pylons just lacks a lot of the things that I want, like built-in auth . Sure, I can roll my own, but I'm lazy. Of course, Django is really meant for the CRUD sort of thing, and I wonder how good it would be beyond that avenue.

Note - I'll be expanding on this over time.
