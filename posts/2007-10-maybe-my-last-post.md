title: Maybe my last post

Tomorrow is my one day of actual time off. I may not have internet connection, but I'll see what I can do. I'm not 100% sure of what I want to do. Pompeii and Herculeneum are very appealing, especially followed by visits to art museums and stuff. The other thought is a day in Capri and Sorrento on the Amalfi coast. Not as much history but much prettier.

Suggestions are welcome!

You have to see Pompeii. See if you can get the "scandalous" tour, that shows the Roman wall art that is hidden to protect innocent eyes. :)
