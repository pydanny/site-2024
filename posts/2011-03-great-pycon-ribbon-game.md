title: The Great PyCon Ribbon Game!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/03/great-pycon-ribbon-game.html)*.

Here is my challenge for attendees of [PyCon 2011](https://us.pycon.org/) - try to win as many volunteer badge ribbons as possible. Whoever gets the most ribbons at PyCon 2011 can claim the title <b>"King of PyCon Badge Ribbons</b>" and I'll write a special blog post for you, your employer/company, and your favorite non-obscene thing.

Rules:


- You have to <b>earn</b> the badge ribbons. You have to give tutorials, make presentations, volunteer left and right, and be a great sport. Stealing ribbons is out. So is trading for them.
- Only real badge ribbons are valid. You can't write your own and tape them onto your badge.
- You must proudly affix the ribbons to your badge.
- Cheaters will be lambasted verbally. You deserve what you get.

In 2010 I managed to earn five (5) PyCon ribbons and only [Wesley Chun](https://us.pycon.org/2011/speaker/profile/151/) beat me. Think you can beat our scores from last year? Think you can beat me this year?
