title: Getting excited about DjangoCon US!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/08/getting-excited-about-djangocon-us.html)*.

[Djangocon](https://djangocon.us/) starts in just a month. I'm looking forward to this event because of so many reasons. Lets go over some of them!

<b>Friends -&nbsp;</b>I'll get to meet with old friends and make new ones. Rather than list names I'm going to mark a sheet of paper with the alphabet and check off letters as I meet/make a friend with the first name that matches an unmarked letter. Which makes me wonder if their is a [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) app for that in the making...

<b>Portland</b> - Great food and awesome beer at cheap prices. The wonderful thing about Portland is that the base ingredients are really good. I found I liked the simpler/cheaper things there more than fancy foods. The food carts alone are worth visiting the city.

<b>Oregon State - </b>It is a beautiful state and since words can't do justice here is an image:

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2656/3897946209_386ea300bc_m_d.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2656/3897946209_386ea300bc_m_d.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me at Mutnomah falls!</td></tr></tbody></table><b>&nbsp;The conference schedule rocks! - </b>The talks they lined up all look really good. They range from the basics to the advanced, and include things that go beyond the technical. Some of my favorite picks from <b>just</b> the first day:



- [Typewar: A Case Study](https://djangocon.us/schedule/sessions/3/) - [James Tauber](https://jtauber.com/) is an incredible speaker, not to mention the founder of [Pinax](https://pinaxproject.com/) and the CEO of [Eldarion](https://eldarion.com/). His talks are best served live. Typewar is an interesting game but the story of its inception and maintenance is a gem for anyone looking to see how the masters do it.
- [So you want to be a core developer?](https://djangocon.us/schedule/sessions/5/) - [Russel Keith-Magee](https://cecinestpasun.com/), a core developer, lets us know what we need to know and do to work on Django core. He got approved for <b>three </b>talks so you know he has to kick butt as a speaker.
- [Maps of Imaginary Lands](https://djangocon.us/schedule/sessions/7/) - [Malcom Tredennick](https://djangocon.us/speaker/profile/58/), another core developer, shows how to use [django.contrib.gis](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/) to set up fancy maps of non-existant places. One day I'll have to do this for a place I created in my youth, a place called 'Dannyland'. Anyway, Malcom also has&nbsp;<b>three</b> talks so he's got to have a lot of cool points.
- [Django Forms: Tips, tricks, and ways to stay out of trouble](https://djangocon.us/schedule/sessions/8/) - [Shawn Ride](https://shawnrider.com/)r of [PBS](https://pbs.org/)&nbsp;fame might not be a core developer but he's another brilliant coder and great speaker. This is a great beginner talk and maybe a decent advanced talk too.

<div>Thats just four great talks described. And its just the tip of the iceberg! This is going to be great!

<b>Edit</b>: Fixed a geography mistake. I am so&nbsp;embarrassed.</div>

Glad you're excited about Portland and environs. However, Multnomah Falls (and Portland, for that matter), are of course in Oregon, not Washington State, so you might want to confine your excitement to south of that part of the Columbia River...

As awesome as Portland is, I think having the conference in other cities would be beneficial for the attendance. 

How about we pick Austin, Seattle, San Fran or Chicago for the next one?

Portland was cool for one week, but I prefer variety and that's part of the reason I am going to Pycon instead of DjangoCon.

Cheers!

@Dimitiri - DjangoCon is planned to be like Pycon, it stays two years in the same place. So next year they'll probably move it somewhere new. Just like Pycon which is going to be in Atlanta in 2011 and Washington, DC in 2012.
