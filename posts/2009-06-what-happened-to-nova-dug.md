title: What happened to NOVA-DUG?
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/06/what-happened-to-nova-dug.html)*.

The [Northern Virginia Django Users Group](https://groups.google.com/group/NOVA-DUG) is still around. Really! So when are we going to hold the next session?

June 8th.

What happened? Why so few meetings recently?

A number of life-changing events happened over the past few months. This month alone I went on vacation, am moving twice. Lots of other stuff that just threw a damper in the works.

Being seeing you on July 8th.
