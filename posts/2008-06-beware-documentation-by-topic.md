Yes, I know its supposed to be '<span style="font-weight: bold;">Browse</span>', but while looking up some documentation and being distracted I took '<span style="font-weight: bold;">Browse</span>' as '<span style="font-weight: bold;">Beware</span>'.  Since it was [Grok](https://grok.zope.org) I immediately thought of rampaging cavemen.
