title: Overview of NASA Science
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/04/overview-of-nasa-science.html)_.

I cooked something up for non-technical family members asking what I did for the NASA Science project. It gets a bit technical in places, but I'm a geek so that's just too bad.

Anyway, you can read it yourself at [So what did I do on the website?](/posts/2008-04-so-what-did-i-do-on-website)

I'm also writing something that gets more technical here. I've got to be careful though cause [The Man](https://hitss.hq.nasa.gov/it_security.htm) will make my life hard if I give out anything that can be construed as a security leak. So for example, if I give out the IP address of the site, that may or may not, under various conditions, be up for consideration as a security leak.

I kid you not.
