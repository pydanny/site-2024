Since October I've barely touched Plone 3.  All my work has been in Plone 2.5.x.  Well, yesterday I got to play in the arena of Plone 3 again on a side project provided by an associate.  And here are some thoughts:


- The new portlet system is really nice.  Even just using it with classic portlets its easier and cleaner.  On the other hand, I don't really grok portlet inheritance yet but I suppose I could have spent more than 20 seconds reading documentation.  ;)

- I appreciate how package architecture works.   While I wish you didn't have to dive so far deep into directories to get to stuff, thats a pretty small quibble.  
- The AJAX is nice.  Speeds up content editing quite a bit and otherwise keeps out of the @#$%ing way.  So nice to have good AJAX!
- While I had my own issues with modifying the Generic Setup, the profiles/default let me figure out how things were working quickly and with absolute accuracy.  There was no 'magic', I just knew how things worked.

In the end, it made me want to leave the world of Plone 2.5.x and join the world of Plone 3 again.
