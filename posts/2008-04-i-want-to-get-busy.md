title: I want to get busy!

Normally I'm very physically active. Yet thanks to general fatigue related to my kidney/back problem, whatever it may be, I've been pretty sedate. Well, its catching up to me because sleep is no longer easily forthcoming.

On the plus side, besides feeling like I could sleep another few hours, I feel great. I didn't cycle in to work, but maybe I should have.
