title: The temptation is very strong...

I want a vacation.  One away from home, my daily chores, work and anything involving responsibility.  A clean break from life.  Our finances are in improving shape, so a vacation is in our reach.  I don't have expensive tastes, and neither does my family.  Preferably I want to go somewhere warm and enjoy the ocean.  The sea gives my soul energy.  Ideally I want a $1000 vacation for the three of us (me, wife, 16-year old son).

However, upon any sort of reflection, now is not the time.  We have so much that needs doing.  A quick list of things to do:


- Take down the dying tree in back ($2300)
- Take down a tree growing on the side of our house ($1000)
- Redo the kitchen sink ($1000)
- Install a dishwasher in the kitchen ($1000)
- Electrical work in the basement ($500)
- Replace the upstairs toilette ($300)
- Replace all our 1960s era windows ($5000)
- Fix the back porch roof ($750)
- Pay back a hospital bill ($300)
- Buy me a new bike ($500)

- Pay back a bigger bill or three ($infinity)

And that is just after a minute of thought.  Bleah.  I think if I can consult more and use leave time to get regular salary while doing so things might be better.  Hrm...
