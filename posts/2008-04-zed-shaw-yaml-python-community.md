title: Zed Shaw, YAML, Python Community
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/04/zed-shaw-yaml-python-community.html)_.

[Zed Shaw posts about something I found annoying](https://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-09.html) about a ways back when I was first exploring Python.

Like Zed, I too have run into the "_YAML is not Python so don't use it, but wait someone else is using something YAML which is not Python so lets use that!_" statement in the early stages of my Python use. Since Zed and I trade emails I should have warned him this would happen but the past few weeks have been hectic.

So this is an official apology to Zed for not giving the warning.

I wish I had given him the warning because that would have been awesome. Likely he would have ignored me, gone down the same path anyway, and then I would have a handy '<span style="font-style: italic;">I told you so</span>' to hold over his head.

Anyway, this is one of those [few things I don't like about Python](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/07/lambdas-no-more.html) or the Python community.
