title: Why do I work for Kraken Tech?
---

On November 16, 2020, I started my first day of employment at [Kraken Tech](https://kraken.tech/). Here's why I love working there.

## The Tech Stack

The tech stack is built on things I know. Python, AWS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. It's been implemented in a very solid way, managing to be both conservative in approach yet innovative in design. While my previous experience has proven useful, I've had the chance to learn new and exciting things. Examples of things I've learned:

- Hashistack on AWS
- React & Next.js

Yet when I think about it, the tech stack isn't the best thing about working for Kraken Tech. I can find the same tech stack in a thousand other organizations.

## The People

It's always a delight to work with bright, positive-minded people who share your excitement for a job or cause. I like being around people who know things I do not, for no other reason than I can learn by osmosis. I enjoy being around them, and can't wait to meet them as the pandemic fades away.

I also am amazed by the same treatment across different groups within the organization. No group or division is looked down on, be they software engineering, customer support, marketing, or executive leadership. We're all considered humans, not resources to be expended.

Yet when I think about it, while I appreciate my co-workers beyond what words can describe, the people aren't the best thing of working for Kraken Tech. I can and have found good people in other places.

## The Diversity

Speaking of people, Kraken Tech is a diversity-minded company. People not like me (white, male, cis, US citizen) are in every role from leadership to writing software to sales to product ownership to various administrative roles. Every day I work with people from different continents with different beliefs and different native languages. For many reasons, this is important to me, for I believe it's not only the right thing to do, but it also increases a team's strength to have a broader set of viewpoints.

Yet when I think about it, the focus on diversity isn't the best thing of working for Kraken Tech. Diversity-focused companies are becoming more common, and some even have better numbers than Kraken Tech.

## The Business

Kraken Tech is a fast-growing company spreading its tentacles to new markets and nations. In the months and years to come, we're disrupting the utility industry. In the meantime, in the three years I've been with the firm it's exploded in value. The parent group went from 1.5 billion to well over 10 billion in value. It's exciting to be part of something growing explosively.

Yet when I think about it, the business isn't the best thing of working for Kraken Tech. I can think of other companies with similar explosive growth, some of whom I interviewed when I was interviewing at Kraken Tech.

# The Ultimate Reason I Work for Kraken Tech

So why did I come to work here? Why do I stay here?

## A Realization

One day in autumn of 2020, while considering new employment, I was talking to many potential employers. Several organizations stood out above all others.

They stood out because they both had a mission to address [global climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).

I realized I could use all my talents and skills to make the planet a better place.

## Concerns About Climate Change

For years I've been concerned about the [changing climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change). I had been reducing my carbon footprint for years, composting, reducing unnecessary travel, and more. I preferred to vote for eco-friendly political candidates. In many other ways, I did what I could, yet always I wanted to do more.

## The Ultimate Reason I Work for Kraken Tech

It's all about this little girl.

I want to give my daughter a better planet. She and her generation deserve to live in the same kind of world I had growing up.

## Enter Octopus Energy Group and Kraken Tech

Kraken Tech is giving me the chance to use everything I've learned in my 27+ years of professional software development to build out [Kraken](https://octopusenergy.group/kraken-technologies), our customer-focused retail utility platform with a focus on renewable energy. They have allowed me to help save the planet for my daughter and all the other kids.

## Kraken Tech Empowers Me to Make a Difference

By selling huge volumes of renewable electricity, providing services that encourage people to reduce their carbon footprint and general energy usage, Octopus is making a direct impact on the issue of climate change. Furthermore, the size and income of the company mean it can have a similar outsized impact on politics as do the armies of lobbyists acting on behalf of the fossil fuels industry.

To put it as simply as possible, Octopus Energy has turned me into a superhero. How awesome is that?
