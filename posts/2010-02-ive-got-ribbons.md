title: I've got ribbons!

Odds are this will be my last post on blogspot. After this it should be on my personal blog.

Anyway, I'm here at [Pycon](https://us.pycon.org). I presented a Pinax tutorial and tomorrow I'm presenting a talk on [Pinax](https://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/15/). I'm also a session chair and plan to help with assembling things for registration. And what do I get out of it?

Ribbons.

RIBBONS!!!

My plan is to have more ribbons than anyone else.

So how many ribbons did you end up with, then?

Steve,

Sounds like the subject of another blog post!
