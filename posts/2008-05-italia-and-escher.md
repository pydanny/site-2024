When I was a little boy visiting my grandparents I discovered a book of drawings by M.C. Escher on their living room table. They were wonderful patterns and designs, surreal worlds, and a place beyond dreams. I have fond memories of sitting on the artsy 1950s era sofa they had and imagining things beyonds worlds. This was home to me.

Flash forward to October 2007 with my Plone Conference trip to Naples. Periodically I would see places, mostly rows of beautiful houses that were unbelievably familiar. I couldn't place why. It just seemed strangely like home, and yet this Amalfi Coast style was something I had never been in the presence of before. Sure, I had seen pictures, but the pictures didn't quite resonate with me the way that actually being there did.

Well, last week while going through some books I found a book I bought 10 years ago on M.C. Escher. His forward describes the 10 odd years he spent on the Amalfi Coast of Italy.

Then it clicked. His art depicted perhaps not the color or the photographic detail of the architecture, but rather its soul. That may sound strange, but it makes sense to me.

Now I know why after visiting there Italy calls to me so strongly.

That and the food. ;)
