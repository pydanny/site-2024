title: 2009 Saturday class schedule is formally confirmed!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/12/2009-saturday-class-schedule-is.html)*.

My proposed class schedule for Saturday morning classes has been approved. It will go onto the web site shortly. I first [blogged](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/12/my-saturday-class-plans-for-2009.html) about it at the start of this month. The specifics class structure will be:

<span style="font-weight: bold;">10:00 AM to 11:00 AM Core Fundamentals</span> (open to all students)
This will be the practice of TKD forms and the individual elements which make up movements in the forms. So we'll go over not just the pattern of the form, but also practice proper stances, how to do the hand techniques correctly, as well as interpretation of what the movements of the forms mean.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">10:45 AM to Noon Intermediate Class</span> (open to all students)
This will be about striking and footwork. The first fifteen minutes will be a warm-up led by a  black belt student for which the participants of the previous class will be exempt. The majority of the class will involve work against heavy bags, kicking shields, and punching targets with footwork and general strength training mixed in.
