title: New Year's Resolutions for 2014
---

Making New Year's Resolutions is something I do every year. It's
important to me. I like to set goals and see how well I do.

Resolutions
===========

-   Write and publish fiction. This is a childhood dream that I would
    like to do.
-   Write and publish as least one new technical book, preferably on
    Python.
-   Learn Haskell or some other interesting programming language.
-   Figure out a way I can make money working in open source efforts. As
    a consultant, this explains why I don't do it more.
-   Visit the two continents I've yet to see. That means Africa and
    Antarctica.
-   See the Grand Canyon.
-   Visit more family.
-   Do 1000 push-ups or similar exercises in a single day. I'm at 300
    now.
-   Pull off an Aú sem Mão (no-handed cartwheel).
-   Blog once a week. That is at least 52 blog entries!
-   Take a fun class with Audrey.
-   Upload all my outstanding pictures to Flickr!
-   Learn how to surf or snowboard.
-   See all my friends. All of them.
-   Work less and enjoy life with Audrey more.

Accomplished
============

-   Release the second edition of Two Scoops of Django.
-   Visited South Africa (Argentina and Brazil!)
-   Visited two new nations, Argentina and Brazil.
-   Went back to the East Coast to visit Philadelphia and places in New
    Jersey.
-   Went back to the Philippines.
-   Took some awesome road trips around the USA. My favorite was driving
    up the Pacific Coast highway.
-   Pulled of an Aú Batido
-   Took a fun class with Audrey. We did woodshop!
