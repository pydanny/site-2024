title: Steel jewelry is in!

What seems to be getting popular are apparently cheaper metal rings made from steel, tungsten, or titanium.  I think this is awesome because I don't want to lose hundreds of dollars on a ring that might slip off my finger, and I don't think anyone else should worry either.

Kudos to Katie, Elizabeth, and Rebbecca for illuminating me.
