title: How fast can I convert a Zope 3 app to Grok?
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/11/how-fast-can-i-convert-zope-3-app-to.html)_.

Figured it would be quick and easy to make a conversion. I'm still new with both frameworks, but since Grok is built doing DRY and KISS and various Ruby/Django-isms, this should be pretty easy.

The application in question is a Zope 3 Captcha server that I wrote. It served as my learning box for doing Zope 3 and got me past most of the Zope 3 hump.
