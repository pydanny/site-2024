title: Cycling in this heat
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/06/cycling-in-this-heat.html)*.

Riding home it was 96 degrees Fahrenheit and according to [weather.com](https://weather.com) it felt like 101.  I've ridden in that before, but yesterday coming home I felt very wiped at the end.  So instead of going to the gym I took a shower and languished in our rather chilly basement.  So how can I manage this better?

Its not just hydration.  I had a carbohydrate heavy breakfast and lunch, which was not ideal.  Greens and fish protein seems to work best for me on hot days.  So I'm trying to do that today.  I'll report later.
