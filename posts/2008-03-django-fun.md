- Very predictable behavior with a few weird exceptions.  Learning curve is very gentle compared to Plone's big hump.
- I couldn't seem to use inheritence in my data models, but I'm wondering if they use old style classes.  In which case I think I have to run the __init__ method on classes when I inherit them.
- Django templates are nice.  IMHO,  better than MYGHTY, GENSHI, or KID.  For non-XML I would say its as good as TAL.  For XML, TAL has the lead since its easier to read.  One nice thing is how you are really blocked from doing any logic in templates and when you do call logic its done in an elegant way.  Yeah, the other methods have it too, but the Django way is fun.
