title: Quick Firefox 3 review

Firefox 3 rocks. Its super fast and as of several days of running it, very stable.  All sites show up just fine.  I heard there may be a problem on Hotmail, but who uses that garbage anyway when you have gmail?

So please, family and friends who use IE, convert away.  No time has been better.
