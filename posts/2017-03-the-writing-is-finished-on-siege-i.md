What happened to Siege? Well, it's been renamed to Siege: The Reluctant Hero.

The book comes out to over 50,000 words, covering thirty-five chapters. It was a long, hard journey to get there, but as I embark on the sequel (38,000 words of that written so far), I find I'm writing faster and better. I guess the old adage that practice makes perfect is correct.

What remains now is the editing and post-processing. I'll admit that the editing part is really hard. I can only do two to four chapters a day before the stress gets to me. Thank goodness my editor is as patient as they are talented.

In any case, the first book should be out in a few weeks. Stay posted!
