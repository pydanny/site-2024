title: What I don't like about Pycon

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/01/what-i-dont-like-about-pycon.html)*.

<div><b>1. Too many awesome events to attend them all</b></div><div>
</div><div>[Thirty incredible tutorials](https://us.pycon.org/2010/tutorials/), over a [hundred sessions](https://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/talks/), and only [Guido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) knows how many [sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2010/sprints/). Everything runs concurrently even with the [GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock).</div><div>
</div><div>However, thanks to [Doug Napoleone](https://dougma.com/)'s great [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) work, its trivial to pick and publish which sessions you want to attend. Doug's work on the [scheduler](https://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/) is just plain awesome. While just plain intuitive to use, the scheduler also has a [wonderful help page](https://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/help).</div><div>
</div><div><b>2. I won't be doing enough session staff work.</b></div><div>
</div><div>Yeah, I'll be working a few sessions but I do want to at times to focus on things critical to me. So that means other people like you, dear reader, [ought to pick up my slack](https://us.pycon.org/2010/helping/session_staff/).</div><div>
</div><div><b>3. Only once a year per continent</b></div><div>
</div><div>One of these years I'm going to try and hit [US Pycon](https://www.blogger.com/us.pycon.org/), [EuroPycon](https://www.europython.eu/), [IndiaPycon](https://in.pycon.org/2009/), and all the others. This would make for an awesome year. It would be like living the life of [James Tauber](https://jtauber.com/), [Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://jacobian.org/), or other geek traveller.</div><div>
</div><div><i>The negativity of this post is a joke. Please don't take it seriously. I am giddy for pycon.</i></div>

Have you ever met fallenrogue?  He's the Plaid Hat guy.  He's more of a Rubyist, but basically he spends his life going from conference to conference.

Sooner or later I'm going to kidnap him and assume his identity.  You'll know it's happened when I disappear and he suddenly becomes a lot more interested in Python.

would be more impressive on Mingus! :-) Looking forward to seeing you and taking the tutorial! And Staying for sprints per your advice.
