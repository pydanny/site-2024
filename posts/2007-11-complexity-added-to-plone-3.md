title: Complexity added to Plone 3
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/11/complexity-added-to-plone-3.html)*.

Mikko Ohtamaa raises some [good points about the problems with adding viewlets in Plone 3](https://blog.redinnovation.com/2007/11/26/could-it-be-possible-to-make-viewlets-simple-again/).  It is too complex.  Design patterns are good, but they can capture your focus and make you do lots more work than you need, and not just necessarily up front.
