title: How do I deploy development code with buildout?
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/11/how-do-i-deploy-development-code-with.html)_.

I've got a project where I want people to run a buildout of Plone 3 that adds in the development trunk into a site, and also creates the admin account and starts up Plone. I know this can be done because p4a does it. However, I want a much simpler version of things.

If I can get this done, then my KSS tutorial is done.
