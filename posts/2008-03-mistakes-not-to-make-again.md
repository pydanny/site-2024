title: Mistakes not to make again

Its not good to check in your code after working 16 hours and then not run a test on it the following morning. I made this mistake this week. Ack.

If you see 'trunk' as a package directory on a server, don't delete again without checking for links. Even if you think you accidentally created it with a svn checkout yourself. Ack.

Work at a job where managers are where they are supposed to be so you can get all your Pycon 2008 papers approved and signed right away.
