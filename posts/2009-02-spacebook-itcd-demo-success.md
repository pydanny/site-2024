title: Spacebook ITCD demo a success!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/02/spacebook-itcd-demo-success.html)*.

Yesterday Katie Cunningham presented on Web 2.0 and our latest implementation, Spacebook at the ITCD NASA HQ event. As always, she nailed the presentation, and handled the questions with skill and grace. Before and after the presentation we demonstrated live Spacebook at our booth. People seemed very interested, and we became skilled and hooking people into Spacebook.

I received the chance to proselytize on the benefits we had from using the Free and Open Source Software community to accelerate our development. We would not have been able to demonstrate a stable, working application without the contribution of the Pinax team. The amount of support we received from them was incredible. In fact, our requirements are helping to drive the growth of Pinax, and thanks to us they will be US Government Section 508 compliant.
