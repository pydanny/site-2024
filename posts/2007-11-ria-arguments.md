I don't like to work in [Rich Internat Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_web_application) (RIAs). Why reinvent the web when we have AJAX?

That said, I have a bit of respect for what Adobe has done with Flex and little respect for OpenLazlo, Silverlight, or JavaFx.

Anyway, someone I know is a huge OpenLazlo fan. I think they are mistaken to be entranced by OpenLazlo. Flex does all that OpenLazlo does, does it better, and does it for the same cost (free). Furthermore, the chart here shows just what the job market is for OpenLazlo, Flex, and other RIAs: [https://blogs.msdn.com/rohant/archive/2007/11/19/so-how-safe-is-your-bet-on-silverlight-wpf-and-net-3-0.aspx](https://blogs.msdn.com/rohant/archive/2007/11/19/so-how-safe-is-your-bet-on-silverlight-wpf-and-net-3-0.aspx)
