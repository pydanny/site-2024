title: wxPython is fun!

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/07/wxpython-is-fun.html)*.

I needed to generate lots of lipsum recently.  I could use [elephantangelchild](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/)'s [greaterLipsum](https://code.google.com/p/greaterlipsum/) but I like fancy GUIs.  So I branched greaterLipsum and wrapped it inside a little [wxPython](https://wxpython.org) app.  Pretty easy to do and it works great.  You can svn the results at the [desktopGreaterLipsum](https://greaterlipsum.googlecode.com/svn/branches/desktopgreaterlipsum/) branch.

I plan to add in new features like being able to choose the text source, making binaries for different operating systems, and other fun things.

In the meantime, it made me remember just how much fun wxPython is in general.  I need to find excuses to work with it more.
