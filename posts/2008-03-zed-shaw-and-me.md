title: Zed Shaw and me

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/03/zed-shaw-and-me.html)*.

I accidentally bumped into [Zed Shaw](https://www.zedshaw.com/) while he was hanging out in the 'Python Ghetto' [book seller](https://www.informit.com/).  Nice guy who believes in standards.  He should have been in Python years ago.  If you don't know who he is,  just know that he is a [very contentious figure in the Ruby on Rails](https://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html) community.

In any case, I can claim that I was the guy who first steered him towards [zc.buildout](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout).
