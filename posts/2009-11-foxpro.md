*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/11/foxpro.html)*.

In the 1990s I was working for a small company doing a mix of help desk support, system administration, and development. I hated the help desk work, didn't like navigating [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows) for system administration, but liked development. Even though development was [Foxpro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxpro).

Yup, Foxpro. All of my Foxpro work was on Foxpro 2.6 for [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS). A few people in the office were working with [Visual Foxpro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro) 5 and 6, which meant a [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) style IDE and whatever object model Foxpro adopted. But I was working in the DOS shell and that seemed easier. At the time I thought a fancy IDE was better, and wasn't until around 2003 that I changed my mind on that subject.

So anyway Foxpro was on the decrease even back in the 1990s. It took a bit of work and some luck to get out of the Foxpro closet. Fortunately I made it out. Yet I still have a soft spot for the language and too. My guess is that it is merely nostalgia for a different time in my life, and if I actually looked at Foxpro I would feel ill.

25 more days to go!
