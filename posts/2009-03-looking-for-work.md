title: Looking for work?
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/03/looking-for-work.html)_.

I work for NASA doing python, plone, and django. My groups has lots of work (developing new applications and maintaining existing ones) and a need for more staff. We are looking for both hungry beginners new to python and experienced pythonistas. We would prefer to hire for local (Washington, DC) full-time positions, but we are also open to consulting from afar.

You do need to be a U.S. citizen and willing to undergo a basic background check. Besides, that, anything goes!

If you are interested, please contact me emailing daniel dot greenfeld dash 1 at nasa dot gov.

Any chance you can bend the US Citizen rule. I'm from the UK, is that close enough :)

@Stuart Marsh

I would love to bend the rule. However, it isn't my call but rather a Presidential directive from the previous administration, who seemed to think that everyone was the enemy. The hope is that our new President will let our allies cooperate more. When that happens we will certainly be looking to hire our friends from England, Australia, Germany, and more.

I tried emailing you with some of my information last week, but I think the email must have gotten lost. Do you need a resume or what? Are there accepted formats?

Thanks,

Mike

@Mike Driscoll,

I never received an email from you at my NASA address, but that is fine. NASA uses Microsoft Exchange which is as good as... well... Microsoft Exchange.

In any case, please send me your resume again to me at daniel dot greenfeld dash 1 at nasa dot gov. We will accept it in Word, ascii, or html formats.
