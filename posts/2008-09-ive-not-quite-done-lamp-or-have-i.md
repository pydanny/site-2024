title: I've not quite done LAMP, or have I?
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/09/ive-not-quite-done-lamp-or-have-i.html)_.

It hit me just now that while I've played with all the individual bits of LAMP ([Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [Apache](https://apache.org/), [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/), [Python](https://python.org)), I've never actually done LAMP per se. I tend to play with [Plone](https://plone.org)/[Zope](https://www.zope.org) professionally, and in my goof off time I prefer to delve into [wxPython](https://wxpython.org), with my [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) work being all too rare. I'm wondering if it might be worth it to do some formal LAMP work, and there might be available work at [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov) for it real soon. 

On the other hand, according to the [Wikipedia entry on LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) the 'M' in LAMP can mean 'middle-ware'. In which case I am professionally doing LAMP every work day.
