*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/03/day-3-pycon-09-talks-im-attending.html)*.



- How AlterWay releases web applications using zc.buildout.
- A winning combination: Plone as a CMS, your favorite Python web framework as a frontend
- Using Sphinx and Doctests to provide Robust Documentation
- Designing a web framework: Django's design decisions

I also plan to attend NASA BOF at 4 p.m and likely the odd Django and Pinax BOF that springs up.
