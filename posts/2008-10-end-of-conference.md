title: End of the conference
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/10/end-of-conference.html)*.

Today is Wednesday.  The last day of the conference ended for me at about 4:30 pm on Sunday.  I spent a week of training, networking, presenting, and coding with a great group of very smart people.  I also got to eat three times in Ethiopian fare, which is nice after a 14 year break from that notable cuisine.

Doing this sort of thing in your own town is interesting.  Except for one night with insomnia, I got enough sleep.  On the other hand, the sense of excitement you get by going far away was missing.  On the plus side, I managed to get some gym time in.  On the other hand, home things were a constant distraction.

Anyway, here is to hoping for the next conference being in a fun country far away!
