title: 10 reasons to go to DjangoCon Europe
---

You should go to [DjangoCon Europe](https://djangocon.eu) in lovely
[Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich),
[Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland). Here are 10
reasons why:

1. # **Chocolate**

So much of what we like about chocolate comes from Switzerland. For
example, Milk Chocolate was invented in Switzerland.

2. # **Keynote speaker: Jacob Kaplan-Moss**

Always a great speaker and fun to be around, he's one of the BDFL's of
[Django](https://djangoproject.com).

3. # **Cheese**

I grew up thinking that Swiss Cheese was just about holes. It's so much
more. I can't wait to try fresh European cheese made by master
craftsmen from the freshest ingredients.

4. # **Keynote speaker: Jessica McKellar**

In a word, Jessica is **incredible**. She's a Twisted core developer,
PSF board member, part of the trio responsible for the gigantic Boston
Python User Group's massive size explosion, and a talented speaker.
She's used her incredible talents and skills to increase diversity in
the community and generally help other people.

5. # **Breakfast**

Muesli was invented in Switzerland. I love Muesli. I was floored by how
much better it was in New Zealand. I can't wait to try it in it's
homeland.

6. # **Web Site**

The DjangoCon Europe site is crazy. I mean, look at all those
animations!

7. # **Talks**

This is a single track event with proven speakers like Zachary Voase and
Andrew Godwin, yet balances that with bringing in new blood to spice
things up. And dare I say I'm giving a technical talk
with Audrey Roy? ;-)

8. # **Mountains**

With all the incredible food, you would think you would gain umpteen
kilograms. Fortunately there are mountains all around to climb and hike.

9. # **Sprints**

Want to sprint on Django itself? Look no further because there will be
Django core developers around! There will also be notable
[Python](https://python.org) developers like [Kenneth
Reitz](https://kennethreitz.com/) and others around working hard on a lot
of different projects. It's going to intense and fun!

10. # **Castles**

Living in the USA, we just don't have anything like castles. DjangoCon
Europe will be near a [small horde of stone
fortifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_castles_and_fortresses_in_Switzerland#Zurich).
Which means if the Zombie Apocalypse happens during the conference,
we'll have many secure places to go. They also make lovely tourist
destinations. :-)

# What are you waiting for?

DjangoCon Europe has a cap on attendance. Tickets for Python events have
been selling out, not just for PyCon US. Don't miss out!

# It's all about me

Yup.

Call me selfish but I want you there because I haven't haven't met all
our European friends yet in person. Hope to see you next month in
Zurich!
