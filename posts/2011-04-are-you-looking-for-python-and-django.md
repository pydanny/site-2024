title: Are you looking for Python and Django Work?
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/04/are-you-looking-for-python-and-django.html)*.

I've done some consulting work for a company in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) that is looking for full time developers of all levels. They've got a solid business model, experienced and excellent leadership, and an existing team of talented developers who do things the right way. The founders and developers have been behind a bunch of things you know and love. The company is stable, well-financed, and offers full benefits.

In short: they're building the dream team. They don't use dumb words like rockstar and ninja: they're looking for quietly competent developers with a taste for travel.

Additional experience with CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, GIS, Git, Linux, and experience with contributing to open source projects are definite pluses.

Before you apply you need to pass this little test of mine. If you fail any portion of of this test then we won't consider hiring you.


- Can you get to the office or are you willing to move closer? When you begin, you need to be able to get to New York City, New York every day of the week. Over time you can work out telecommuting options.&nbsp;
- Are you a solitary developer? I'll throw away any responses from recruiters and consulting firms.
- Bonus Question: Not a requirement but do you have any open source contributions from any languages to share?
- Can you send your resume to my email address 'hidden' in the code below? To do that, you'll need to know enough about Python to run this code:

<ol></ol><blockquote>numbers = [83, 101, 110, 100, 32, 114, 101, 115, 117, 109, 101, 32, 116, 111, 32, 112, 121, 100, 97, 110, 110, 121, 64, 112, 121, 100, 97, 110, 110, 121, 46, 99, 111, 109, 32, 119, 105, 116, 104, 32, 115, 117, 98, 106, 101, 99, 116, 32, 111, 102, 32, 39, 108, 111, 102, 116, 121, 39]

''.<span style="color: #000099;">join</span>([chr(x) for x in numbers])</blockquote>

Nice little recrutement test, unfortunately I fail at number 1 (currently living in the south of France) and 0 (I'm self employed and loving it).

Fun read though

Hope you build your dream team

@David,

South of France? I don't blame you for wanting to stay! Anyway, the team is already pretty dreamy, they just want it dreamier. :)

For me, it’s Lake Constance and I’d just like to participate as a Freelancer... ;-)
BTW: Your feed’s missing a link to your blog!

@Hraban- just do a morning commute across the globe! :)

More like bytearray(numbers).

I do believe the subject should read &quot;[108, 111, 102, 116, 121]&quot; for any serious applications :P

Cute python test. :-)

Very good idea to get interested python developers intrigued.
