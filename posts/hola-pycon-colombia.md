title: Hola, PyCon Colombia!
---

We (me and Audrey) are going to be giving a keynote speech at [PyCon
Colombia](https://www.pycon.co/) on February 11th! Hooray!

<div class="ui embed" data-source="youtube" data-id="AS3nCSkdxFM"></div>

We'll be arriving in Medellin late evening on February 7th and staying
a while longer after the conference so we can have the time to explore
the lovely city of
[Medellin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn). We're very
excited, because travel is a rarity for us now and Medellin (and the
surrounding area) is supposed to be quite beautiful. Plus, all the
Colombians we know online are excellent people - we can't wait to meet
them!

Our hope is that on the day(s) after [PyCon
Colombia](https://www.pycon.co/) we can see the sights and eat the foods
with Colombians who know Medellin. So let me know if you want to meet
up!

Hasta pronto!
