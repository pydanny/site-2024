_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2012/02/silicon-beach-hackercast.html)_.

Near the end of January of 2012 I was at the [10th Southern California Linux Exposition](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale10x/) (SCALE 10X). I gave an [Intro to Python talk](https://speakerdeck.com/u/pydanny/p/intro-to-python), helped man the awesome [Python](https://python.org) booth, and hung out with a lot of awesome people. One of those awesome people I got to spend time with was [Andrew Cholakian](https://www.andrewvc.com/), a Ruby and Clojure developer, and the organizer of [LA Hacker News](https://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hacker-News/). We've been meaning to do something together, and at the conference we decided to do a broadcast together.

Jump forward a few weeks and Andrew came over to our place in the San Fernando Valley for a day of brainstorming, web site building, and broadcasting. We outlined a show and started to record.

<h3>Topics of Discussion</h3>

The show was a lot of fun to do. We plan to do more of them, perhaps every few weeks. A better microphone is definitely in the works.
