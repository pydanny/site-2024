... just a few years back I got in trouble for getting trac/svn for a critical project I was leading. I had myself, two developers, a project manager, business analyst, and a manager best described as the quintessential pointy haired boss. Our company thought at that point that version control and web based ticketing was crazy, edgy, dangerous stuff. Nope, tickets were to be controlled by sharing Excel spreadsheets and zip was how you handled version control.

I'm glad those days are gone.
