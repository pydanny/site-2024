title: No Person Is an Island
---

I always try to get write at least 1500 words a day. Sometimes I manage to achieve more, like this past Sunday when I managed to hit the amazing number of 6000 words!

Yet so far today I've held off from writing. Why?

Yesterday I wrote Chapter 27 of Siege. When it was done, I wasn't happy. Something was missing and figuring it out took most of today.

It boils down to the idea that no person is an island. While Vetch might be self-absorbed at times, he's part of a greater community of friends and family. Together, they are greater than the sum of their parts.

There are times to separate him from that community (like chapter 24), but that was part of the drama there. The scenes I had in mind for chapter 27, on the other hand, should continue to include him in his community.

The end result is that when Vetch must be separated from friends and family, it carries more weight.
