title: Can I be a bit snarky here?
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/09/can-i-be-bit-snarky-here.html)_.

So I've worked professionally with a number of different languages now. Let me see: Foxpro, Perl, PHP, ColdFusion, Java, T-SQL, PL-SQL, Javascript, and lastly Python

And which language is getting me sent to Italy and California?

Python.

Sure, I can be all geeky about how Python's dynamic typing, multi-paradigm, scaling, and low/high level capabilities makes it uber-powerful.

But who cares.

I'm going to be eating Pizza in Naples.

Python wins hands down.
