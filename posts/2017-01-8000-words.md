title: 8000 Words!

It's Monday morning, the beginning of the work week. Don't be sad, because I bring two awesome things to you:

1. On Saturday I wrote over <b>EIGHT THOUSAND WORDS</b>. That's a record for me. 

2. All those words allowed me to <b>FINISH</b> the storyline of Siege! It tops off at thirty-four chapters plus a glossary section I use to track people, places, and things. Yes, it still needs proofing, editing, and cleanup, but the hardest part is done! <b>HOORAY</b>!
