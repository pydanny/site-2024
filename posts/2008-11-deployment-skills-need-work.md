title: Deployment skills need work
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/11/deployment-skills-need-work.html)*.

I love being a developer.  I love writing code, juggling objects, doing configurations, doing database stuff, styling HTML, and implementing themes.  What I do hate is deployment.  So while I feel empowered by tools like distutils, zc.buildout, and variations therein, actually doing that sort of work is very tedious to me.  In both my dayjob and side consulting I have very good people to do that sort of thing for me so all I need to do is basic deployment work.

However, I readily admit this is a shortcoming.  One I should work to fix.

The good people of [Six Feet Up](https://www.sixfeetup.com) had a [deployment workshop](https://www.sixfeetup.com/news/plone-deployment-workshop) this month that I did not attend.  If I wanted to I might have been able to press for it as a class, but had other things on my mind.  I'm wondering if it is offered again if it makes sense to go next time.
