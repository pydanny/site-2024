title: NOVA-DUG April 15th summary

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/04/nova-dug-april-15th-summary.html)*.

Forour first meeting there was seven people and several cancellations. Not bad for short notice and rain. Attendees (first name only for now - I will update if attendees contact me and request their names/jobs):


- Eric (possibly providing meeting space!)

- Sal

- Jack
- James
- Cory
- [Katie](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/)

- [Danny](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/) (me!)

There was talk of [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) projects still under development, with one public effort exposed by Sal:


- [https://www.concentrateme.com](https://www.concentrateme.com/) Django powered search analytics tool.

We explained [Pinax](https://pinaxproject.com/) to Sal. In return [South](https://south.aeracode.org/) was mentioned by Sal as a functional Django migration tool (thanks to everyone who pointed me at the right place). Corey talked about the limitations of the Django ORM compared to [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). I think we agreed to disagree about templates. Everyone griped about the quality of the [Panera](https://www.panerabread.com/) coffee shop's wireless network.

Upcoming planned events:


- [EuroDjangoCon](https://euro.djangocon.org/) US-DC area sprint (May 7-8)
- [Django Dash](https://djangodash.com/) get-together (May 30-31)

We chatted about a bi-weekly schedule. We may have to do some juggling to avoid falling on the same weeks as [ZPUG-DC](https://www.zpug.org/) or [Django District](https://groups.google.com/group/django-district).

Future format ideas include user presentations, voting on the open source django presentation of the week, and planned attacks on user problems.
