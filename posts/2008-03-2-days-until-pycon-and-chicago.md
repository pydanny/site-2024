title: 2 days until Pycon and Chicago

Am I excited about Pycon 2008? Heck yeah!

Do I care about being in Chicago? Erm. Not really. I've never been but I don't like it when its cold and windy. And I doubt staying in a hotel park next to the airport is conducive to doing anything noteworthy in a city. Naples was filthy, but historical. The food was all really good. We walked a lot. Drank cheap but incredible table wine. Sampled pizza and pasta at places in gastronomical history.

Someone give me something fun to do or a good place to eat in Chicago.

Please.
