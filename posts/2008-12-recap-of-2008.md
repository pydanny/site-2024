title: Recap of 2008
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/12/recap-of-2008.html)_.

- I went to Chicago for the first time. The architecture was beautiful. The local food was quite good, nearly as good as the Neapolitan fare I had in 2007.

- Cycled through New York City and reconnected with old family relations.

- Kept up with the martial arts. Competed twice.

- Almost up to 5 years without a broken bone!!!

- Worked another year with Python and Plone. Started to work professionally with Django.

- Stayed with NASA. Managed to see my team evolve into a group that doesn't make me want to pull out my non-existent hair.

- Launched our big project at work ([https://nasascience.nasa.gov](https://nasascience.nasa.gov/))

- Got my son into physical fitness again.

- Shaved my head.

- Got our finances more in order.

- Helped shepherd my students forward for the most part. I'm so proud of them.

- Didn't lose anyone close to me.

Update:

- Worked with [Alex Clark](https://aclark.net) to launch [Take Back the Tap](https://www.takebackthetap.org/).

- Helped support [Food and Water Watch](https://foodandwaterwatch.org/).

- Lasted another year (4 years) at NASA.

- Had a painful kidney ailment in the spring that was a combination of bruising and dehydration.
