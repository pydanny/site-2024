I was rather ill Saturday morning. I normally don’t drink at all, and hangovers are never good for me. I woke up with a crushing headache compounded by caffeine withdrawal. I showered and ran downstairs and gobbled down some excellent coffee from the hotel breakfast. That stopped the worst of the headache but I still was not at my best.

# Plone Fun

Now I got to build on the lessons learned during the other parts of this trip. I haven’t been happy with the KSS documentation for a number of technical reasons, and I wanted some practice. For reference, KSS is the Plone AJAX engine, which allows Plone to do things of the same sort as gmail or flickr. So what I did was create a new tutorial for KSS, complete with a demo package.

I was joined by Carsten Rebbein and we quickly found a good pattern of effort. I did most of the writing and we shared the technical tasks. We used a buildout script to generate the demo package, and leveraged in my new Zope 3 skills to build the package. We each cooked up an KSS/AJAX demo, and integrated it into the tutorial.

Alas, I wasn’t at my best so the first half of the day I was lagging. Compounding that was when I was plugging my Mac OS X into a power socket and smacked my head hard into an obstacle. Ouch!

We didn’t quite finish the tutorial, but we got a lot done.

Keep in mind we started at 10 am or so and ended about 8 pm. 10 good hours of work!

# Finding Friends

Near the end of the day Florian Freisdorf showed up back from Munich, Germany. He had been in the Zope 3 class but had to return to his university for several days. He is an academic on the Phd track and very smart. He didn’t have a place to stay yet, and would either stay in the youth hostel or find a hotel downtown.

I bumped into Jens Klein again. I hadn’t realized it, but he was the Austrian mastermind behind ArchGenXML! This is an incredible Python tool that converts UML diagrams into a working Plone application. This guy is really smart and the surprising thing is that the way he does his abstract thinking is amazingly like how I do it. His next big project, Genesis, is very interesting and I’m wondering if maybe I should get involved.

# Dinner Again

Chris and Reed were tired and ate close to Albergo del Golfo. I decided I really wanted to eat at Pizzaria Port’alba, the world’s oldest pizza restaurant. Florian, Jens, and Carsten joined me there for food and excellent discussion. I selected the house special, which was dough, sauce, and muscles and clams in the shell. It was brilliant. Not quite as good as Pizza Sorbilla, but very close.

# Sightseeing?

As you can see, I’ve had no time for sightseeing. I keep meaning to get up early and wander down to the harbor which is just a few blocks away. Alas, the pace of my journey here is too fast and too long each day for me to find that time. Oh well, I shall have to squeeze that all into my last day here, which is entirely dedicated to sightseeing.
