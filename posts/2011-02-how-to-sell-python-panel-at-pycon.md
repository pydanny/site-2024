title: How to sell Python panel at Pycon
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/02/how-to-sell-python-panel-at-pycon.html)*.

Do you want to use&nbsp;[Python](https://python.org/)&nbsp;but are you fighting Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt ([FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt)) in your organization? Does any of this sound familiar to you?


- Python is just a scripting language.
- Python is too new to use in real production environments.
- Language X has better benchmarks doing obscure math so it is better for web development.
- Python sounds great but we've already spent so much on this expensive tool that does things badly!

A lot of people want to use Python, but their customer, management, school, government, or organization won't let them. Python is a great tool, but can be challenging to get in the door. [This panel](https://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/72/) will explore how companies and individuals have successfully introduced Python, what tools are available to sell Python, how to fight the good fight, and what pitfalls there are to avoid.

<b>Panel Questions</b>
For [this event at Pycon](https://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/72/)&nbsp;I've got some stock questions ready but I want the community at large to&nbsp;[suggest some more](https://goo.gl/mod/5uKk).

<b>Speakers</b>
For this panel I choose five speakers from the broad categories of academia, government, commercial organizations, and non-profit who have had a known impact in their organizations:

<b>Academia</b>
[C. Titus Brown](https://www.mmg.msu.edu/brown.html) is an Open source hacker, Artificial Life/Digital Evolution, B.A. Math (Reed), Earthshine research, Ph.D. Developmental Biology and Regulatory genomics (Caltech), Python testing tools, Python Software Foundation member, Assistant Professor (Michigan State U.) - dev bio, genomics, metagenomics, software engineering.&nbsp;

<i>Note: A lot of my personal understanding on how to do web tests outside of Selenium is thanks to a Pycon tutorial given by Dr. Brown and Grig Gheorghiu back in 2008.</i>&nbsp;

<b>Government</b>
Chris Shenton is a partner at [Koansys LLC](https://koansys.com/), a consulting company whose clients include US Federal Government agencies, Internet startups, and non-profit organizations. He is a free software and UNIX bigot, advocating for the use of both in organizations large and small. He's been involved with the Washington DC area's [Python/Zope/Plone user group ZPUGDC](https://meetup.zpugdc.org/) for years, and recently was appointed to its board.&nbsp;

<i>Note: Chris has the dubious honor of introducing me to Python in 2005 and was pivotal in promoting the adoption of Python for use in NASA's [Science Mission Directorate](https://science.nasa.gov/).</i>&nbsp;

<b>Large Business</b>The Vice President of Engineering at [Evite/IAC](https://new.evite.com/), [Dan Mesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmesh) is the person credited by other Evite staff with bringing Python to life in that business.&nbsp;

<i>We used Evite for our just passed [LA area hackathon](https://www.opensourcehackathon.com/) and plan to use it for future events.</i>&nbsp;

<b>Non-Profit Organizations</b>
[Rich Leland](https://richleland.com/) is an Application Architect at National Geographic where he uses Python on a daily basis to work on [nationalgeographic.com](https://nationalgeographic.com/) and its ecosystem of web sites. He is also the founder of [django-district](https://www.meetup.com/django-district/), a group for [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) users in the Washington, DC area. In the past life he worked for [Discovery Channel](https://dsc.discovery.com/) as Designer and Lead Web Developer.&nbsp;

<b>Small Business</b>
Frank Wiles is President of [Revolution Systems](https://www.revsys.com/), Lawrence, KS. Expert in Internet infrastructure scaling and performance. Primarily focused on Django and PostgreSQL.&nbsp;

<i>Note: I credit Frank with providing me with a great opportunity to work with an [awesome code base](https://www.revsys.com/blog/2011/feb/07/big-secret-project-ive-been-working/)&nbsp;but also the encouragement and support to get me through my first year as a freelance consultant.</i>
