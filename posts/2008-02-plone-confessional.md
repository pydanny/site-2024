Everyone in the Plone community has Professional Plone Development, right?

Until last night, everyone but me.

Since I'm just now working in Plone 3 I found simply using Google or Plone.org wasn't enough. Sure, Plone 3 is wonderfully clear in ways but finding some good information on portlets is proving to be nearly impossible. Its just too new to have everything documented.

I purchased the pdf version and started to read. Martin Aspelli either writes good or has good editors. No matter, its good stuff. And once I get paid for my Plone 3 work I'll see some trees killed so I can have a paper version.
