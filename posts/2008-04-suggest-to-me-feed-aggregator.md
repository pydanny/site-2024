title: Suggest to me a feed aggregator!
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/04/suggest-to-me-feed-aggregator.html)_.

I need a good RSS/Atom aggregator. I'm not having any luck. And this is giving me issues because I can't remember everyone's blogs I like to peruse. Any suggestions?

Tried [Google Reader](https://www.google.com/reader) and hated it. Updates happened haphazardly and the interface was confusing. The one google product I can't stand.

Tried [Rojo](https://www.rojo.com/) and it would be great but I can't seem to easily add my own @#$% RSS feeds. No dice - instead I have to search for everything. WTF?

Or should I perhaps write my own in [Django](https://djangoproject.com)? Or a local version in [wxPython](https://wxpython.org)? I've worked with [FeedParser](https://feedparser.org/) a number of times and it is an easy API. So is [Beautiful](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)[ Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for that matter.

@anonymous, this works great on my gnome installation of Ubuntu. But not on Mac. :( I want something neutral!
