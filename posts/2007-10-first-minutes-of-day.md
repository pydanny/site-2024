title: First minutes of the day

I just woke up. Its 8 am. Today I leave for Italy at 6:24 pm. That means I have about 10 hours left in the United States, my birthplace and home for the last four decades.

It doesn't feel like its actually happening. I was told the chances of a funded trip were slight. Then, getting the passport so quick was another slight chance. So I feel like today is a dream I'm about to wake from.

Anyway, I'm pretty much ready. Now I just wait. I am teaching at the gym for two hours so that will eat up a nice chunk of time. And I need to do my electronic check-in for the airfare tickets. I need to take a bike over to Chris Shenton's place. Otherwise I've got nothing to do but twiddle my thumbs.

Enough melancholy! I'm off to Italy today!
