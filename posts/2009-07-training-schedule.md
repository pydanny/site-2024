*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2009/07/training-schedule.html)*.

My [plans in January](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2009/01/my-current-training-schedule.html) for getting ready were stymied a bit. Not that I haven't worked out, because I have. In fact, I am in phenomenal shape, even if at the moment I am fighting off the summer flu. So how are my goals coming along?

<span style="font-size: 180%;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Drop some weight. </span>
Did not manage it. On the other hand, I look like I lost weight. What I did is put on muscle in my legs, core, and torso, and secondarily in my shoulders and arms.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Get faster. Much faster.</span>
I am faster now. When I get a few days off to recover I'm pretty snappy quick.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Increase endurance.</span>
The cycling, extra weights, and extra martial arts paid off. Especially the cycling. I can go a long, long time at full speed.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Improve technique.</span>
Most of my strikes and stances are pretty good. I wish my stances were better, but I'll never be happy there.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Make the test look easy.</span>
I've got the strength, speed, and endurance that I want. My technique is pretty crisp too.
