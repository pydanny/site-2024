title: What I learned at Pycon 2009
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/04/what-i-learned-at-pycon-2009.html)*.

Why write a repetition about all the things that everyone else has documented the greatness of [Pycon 2009](https://us.pycon.org/) when I can write about the awesome stuff I learned?


- How to use [Python](https://python.org/) via [XLRD](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd) and [XLWT](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt/) to handle truly brobdingnagian Excel files (8 million records anyone) without anything Microsoft.
- New Internet scraping tools like [html5lib](https://code.google.com/p/html5lib/) and [mechanize](https://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/) to reinforce [lxml](https://codespeak.net/lxml/) and the fading but still lovable [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/).
- Many awesome things about the [Sphinx](https://sphinx.pocoo.org/) documentation experience.

- That spending a day in test focused sessions is an intense experience.
- [argparse](https://code.google.com/p/argparse) makes writing command line python interactions so much easier. 
- Good rules of thumb for breaking apart applications in not just [Django](https://djangoproject.com/), but for python modules in general.

- [Git](https://git-scm.org/)! The Pinax community embraced Git just as I was started to work on it. I owe a lot to Brian Rosner's patient coaching, and Jannis Leidel's patience.
- That I am addicted to checking on the [Github](https://github.com/) graphs to see how I compare.
- 15 minutes of sitting next to James Tauber gave me the grounding I wanted in [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) event handling.
- That people who hate XML based template languages HATE them. HATE HATE HATE.
- Mashed potatoes and bacon pizza is yummy. And spinach and anchovy pizza rocks. Yes, I ate anchovies and oddly enough liked them. 
- I really want to teach python, Django, and [Pinax](https://pinaxproject.com/). I may not be the best coder by far, but I think this could be the largest contribution I ever make to this community.


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some of what  I need to follow up on</span>


- [GeoDjango](https://geodjango.org/)
- [sql-python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sqlpython) 
- [content-mirror](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inquant.contentmirror)

 Did I miss anything? Let me know!

Danny, I'd like to see you blog in more detail on the "rules of thumb for breaking apart applications in not just Django, but for python modules in general."

And thanks for the reminder about argparse.
