title: New water heater

Late last night we finally finished getting our old water heater replaced.  What a difference!  Went from 5 minutes of lukewarm water that took many hours to recover to a never-ending stream of scalding goodness.  Bonus is that the new water heater is much more energy efficient to boot.

This morning I dragged the kid out of bed and pushed him grumbling into the shower.  He was not happy when he woke up and there was resentment in the air.  He came out 25 minutes later with a glowing smile on his face and said, "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now I see why you woke me up early.</span>"

The simple pleasures are some of the best ones.
