title: To Shell is to love Python

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/05/to-shell-is-to-love-python.html)*.

One thing I like about Python is the shell.  Or if you have rights, the iPython shell.  Combine that with PDB (Python Debugger) and you get quick, accurate insights into the behavior of snippets of code.  You can tweak things to your heart's delight.  I think list comprehension would not be as much fun as it is if python did not have a shell.

I think one of my future prerequisites for new languages (not that I'm looking) is that the language have a shell.
