Coming (of course)! It seems I can't get away from feeding people, can I? ;)

Would like to come and meet everyone, but it's a little far from Bethesda. Boo!

**Eddie said on 2009-09-30**

Katie, if it's any consolation, I am feeding all kinds of people all the time... if you figure out some sort of prevention, let me know.
