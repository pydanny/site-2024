title: Psuedo Code to Real Code
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/07/psuedo-code-to-real-code.html)_.

We always say it about Python, that our hand scratch code often becomes real code. That what other people sue to map out their thought processes is what we code in.

Well, over last weekend I was coding away on a personal project and typed in 150 lines of code. When I started to debug, I found I was done.

Not bad.
