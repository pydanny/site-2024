title: Learn something new every year
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/01/learn-something-new-every-year.html)_.

<div>As developers, we all make that pledge, don't we? Some of us learn new languages, new frameworks, new APIs, new methodologies. Rarely do we learn a new operating system.</div><div>
</div><div>30 years ago I was using whatever they called the operating system on the [Apple ][ series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series) of computers. 20 years ago I learned to use [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS). 17 years ago I added [Windows 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x) to that mix. 15 years ago I ran into [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows) 95 and the subsequent set of 98, 2000, Me, and XP. 10 years ago I started to play with [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix), mostly learning the simple shell commands needed to shuffle files around. 3 years ago I commenced working on [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X). </div><div>
</div><div>During my Windows 98 days I was forced in doing help desk and system administration work. I hated it. The pop-up menus were not intuitive. Documenting what you did was hence agony. I begged my job to make me a pure developer but they forced me to continue down the path of Windows administration. Eventually I left that job and became a pure developer.</div><div>
</div><div>Over the years I got better at Unix and Linux. I even set up two servers for production use, one running [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server) 1.3.x around 2001 and and the other a whole bunch of [JBOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBOSS) stuff in 2003. Finding documentation was a pain, but the sense of logic compared to the chaos of windows pop-ups was a relief.  After that when I would touch Unix or Linux it was basic file management stuff and nothing sophisticated, and my beginner skills never got a chance to grow further.</div><div>
</div><div>Flash forward to 2007 and beyond where I did serious [Python](https://python.org/) development for [Plone](https://plone.org/) and then [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) applications. Development was on Mac OS X and production was Linux. My neophyte level skills no longer where quite enough. Our system administrator and other co-workers helped out or did the work but it limited and frustrated me. Nevertheless, the time to really bone up on Linux never happened.</div><div>
</div><div>Well, this past week has been a crash course in ramping up my Linux skills. The next version of [SMD Spacebook](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/search/label/spacebook) will be put into production as an [RPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager). Its been assigned my task to do it. This would involve a lot more in the way of Linux that what I was used to, since I needed to create an environment to run the RPM build commands, and that couldn't be our testing or production environments. That meant a chunk of setup and configuration of a lot of packages, and various proprietary bits and pieces in order to meet government and corporate requirements.</div><div>
</div><div>I tried not to bug my co-workers too much except for when their documentation didn't quite explain everything, and then I added to their documentation. I'm still a beginner but I feel like I've finally gotten a chance to spread my wings in this arena a little bit and learn a lot.</div><div>
</div><div>This will make it easier for me when I finally get around to getting this blog off [blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) and into what will probably be [Django-Mingus](https://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus).</div>
