title: Need to get into the habit of using Python sets
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/11/need-to-get-into-habit-of-using-python.html)_.

Periodically I have use cases where I want lists with unique values. And I so often write logic to do it on my own. You know, things like `if 'hello' not in mylist: do x()`. Well, I need to stop doing that and remember to use sets.
