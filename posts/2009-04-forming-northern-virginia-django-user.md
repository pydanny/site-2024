title: Forming a Northern Virginia Django User Group
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/04/forming-northern-virginia-django-user.html)*.

There is already a Django User Group in the Washington, DC area ([Django District](https://groups.google.com/group/django-district)). However, it looks like they meet in Silver Spring. Yuck. I live in Arlington, VA and I don't drive. I'm sure they are a nice bunch of people, but I want something more accessible.

I <span style="font-weight: bold;">am</span> a member of the [Zope/Python User's Group of DC](https://www.zpug.org/), which is organized by awesome [Alex Clark](https://aclark.net/). It has been going on for ages. Unfortunately they meet on Tuesdays which does't work for me or [Katie Cunningham](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/) except maybe once a year.

See, what I want in a user's group is one that meets on a Wednesday or maybe Thursday once a month or so in a metro-accessible place with wifi in Arlington, Virginia. [None](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/) Katie agrees. So we are going to form what I nominally call the Northern Virginia Django User Group (shortened perhaps to Nova-DUG). We'll discuss and show off Django and the odd bit of [python](https://python.org/) and [pinax](https://pinaxproject.com/). We will be happy to run periodic events with Django-District, and we'll make sure not to fall in the same week as them. Should be fun for all!

More details as we cook them up.

Glad to hear about this! I know some of the people interested in django-district had issue with the SS location too, so this will help.

Look forward to coming down for a meetup and doing some joint events!

There's a bunch of Python/Django people at PBS, too (I work at the NewsHour). I'll pass the word around.

@richleland: I'm glad django-district is excited to work with us folks in Northern Virginia. :)

@Chris: Yes! Please let PBS know we are forming up.
