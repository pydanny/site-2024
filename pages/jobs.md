Employers that focus in particular on decarbonization and other aspects of climate change are listed first, and get Earth emoji (🌎🌍🌏) by their name.

In fact, Six Feet Up has a formal initiative they call [IMPACTFUL](https://sixfeetup.com/company/our-mission#objective) that is inspirational. More organizations should choose to take positive action in this manner.
