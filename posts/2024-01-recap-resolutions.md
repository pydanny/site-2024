Another year in orbit around a star.

# Recap for 2023

- [We moved to London](/posts/2023-10-we-moved-to-london)
- Truly enjoyed being the husband of [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](https://audrey.feldroy.com/)
- Embraced the delights being the father to [Uma Roy Greenfeld](/tags/uma) in her fourth year in the universe 
- I trained more in [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)](/tags/bjj)
- I tried [HEMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_European_martial_arts) and Japanese Jiu-Jitsu
- [I lost 9kg/20 lbs and got into much better shape](/posts/2023-04-my-fitness-journey)
- I got injured, hurt my shoulder in a bicycle accident
- I went to Paris for the first time! To speak at a [Django event](https://www.meetup.com/django-paris/events/296277353/) and take in the sights. Really enjoyed the [Eurostar train that took us from London to Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostar) - easier than a plane!
- Visited family in my home state of New Jersey. Also went to New York
- Started up a [Today I Learned (TIL) segment](/tags/TIL) on this blog
- Focused on code instead of leadership. I switch between code and leadership every few years, so it is exciting to be in a new cycle
- Spoke at [Pycon Italy](https://2024.pycon.it), returning to Italy for the first time in 10 years
- For the first time since 2009, attended a pycon ([PyCon UK](https://2023.pyconuk.org/)) not as a speaker, but just to learn and socialize
- Relearned to take holidays/vacation time, "working smarter less not harder more" is the way to go. I clearly get more stuff done and am so much more creative if I don't overwork
- Spent more time with friends
- Gave away most of my stuff in Los Angeles, keeping only true family relics
- Launched a fun, new, useful open-source package, my first in years. It is called **dj-notebook**, here is the [repo](https://github.com/pydanny/dj-notebook) and here is the [docs](https://dj-notebook.readthedocs.io/)
- Finished [my third year at Kraken Tech](/posts/2023-11-three-years-at-kraken-tech) of Octopus Energy Group
