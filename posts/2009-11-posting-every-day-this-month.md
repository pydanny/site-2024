title: Posting every day this month
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/11/posting-every-day-this-month.html)*.

It is customary amongst some to post something on your blog every day of November. There is at least one site for this sort of thing ([https://www.nablopomo.com](https://www.nablopomo.com/)). I think I'm going to try out this strange custom. So that means between now and November 30th each day will see some new content added to this blog.

If you are doing the same thing (blogging each day this month), let me know and I'll link to your blog from here.

So here is to 29 more blog entries!
