title: My students take the big test
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/06/my-students-take-big-test.html)*.

I teach quite a few teenagers and kids martial arts.  Most of it is Tae Kwon Do but I mix in Muay Thai and Kali from time to time.  Anyway, seven of my teens are testing this Friday (6/20/2008) for either their apprentice black belt or full black belt.  This, for what its worth, is a big deal.  Why?

Our school is really rough.  It takes 4 - 7 years to get ready to test for black belt here, often leaning to about 6 years.  We have high expectations for our students, and at black belt level testing, the students fail about 50% of the time.  Compare that to the belt factory schools where you get your black belt in 2 years regardless of your knowledge or skill, but rather based on the fact that you are willing to shell out $750 for a black belt.

Anyway, I'll be there.  If you are interested in coming to watch the effort of years of work let me know.  Just so you know, this is not a demonstration, and it is not a tournament.  This is a grueling test, where for at least the first hour we'll have exhausted the students to see how they perform under duress.  So the technique may not look pretty, even if the students can be really impressive when they are fresh.
