title: Belt test this Friday!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2009/07/belt-test-this-friday.html)*.

This Friday I'll be testing for my third degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. The details if you want to come and watch me kick, punch, stomp, and scream in a set of angry white pajamas:

Time: tentatively 4:45pm
Location: 6408 Williamsburg, Blvd, Arlington, VA 22207
Phone: 703-536-9495

Just so you know, there will be a <span style="font-weight: bold;">lot of people</span> coming to watch. A number of my students and fellow martial artists will be there to watch and provide support. Others will be testing so their families and friends will be there. So if you want a chair to sit in, <span style="font-weight: bold;">I suggest you come early</span> or bring your own.

Also, the test can go on for a long, long time. This test will go on for hours. Feel free to bring a snack and drink. If you need to leave early, that is perfectivly acceptable.
