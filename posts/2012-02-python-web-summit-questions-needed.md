title: Python Web Summit Questions needed!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2012/02/python-web-summit-questions-needed.html)*.

I've been fortunate enough to land a moderating spot at the invitation only&nbsp;[March 8th Python Web Summi](https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/WebDevSummit/)t that takes place at [PyCon US 2012](https://us.pycon.org/2012). The panel I'll be moderating is the somewhat contentious issue of code reuse across different Python frameworks. I'm working on some questions, but I would love input from the entire Python Web Community.

If you've got questions to ask, or ideas to suggest, please post them on this [google moderator link](https://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=1c9a94&t=1c9a94.43).
