title: Top 5 Design Tips for Skinning Plone
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/10/top-5-design-tips-for-skinning-plone.html)_.

# Tip 5 - Centered Design

```css
/* Fixed width */
#visual-portal-wrapper {
  width: 980px;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}

/* Liquid Design */
#visual-portal-wrapper {
  width: 980px;
  margin-left: 20%;
  margin-right: 20%;
}
```

# Tip 4 - integration of IE

- put all stuff in IEFixes.css
- Write styles for IE7 first
- Then hack your styles for other IE version
- portal top is top part of Plone
- For IE6 and lower hack:

```css
/* Below is IE7 , Firefox, and Safari */
#portal-top {
  background: blue;
}
/* below is IE6 version */
html #portal-top {
  background: red;
}
```

- easy to use
- almost no chance of breakage

# Tip 3 - Styles alterations

- different sections styling
- site root
- news: blue
- products:orange
- events: yellow;
- about:green
  how:

```css
body.section-news {
  background-color: blue;
}
body.section-products {
  background-color: orange;
}
/* This is auto-written and any_custom_view
could be working_group.pt */
body.template-any_custom_view {
  background-color: spotted duck;
}
/* example */
body.template-working_group_view.pt {
  background-color: spotted duck;
}
```

# Tip 2 - Drop down menus

- Suckerfish for Plone 2.5.x
- Accessible
- valid CSS
- Obvious and clean XHTML
- Plone Dropdowns is for Plone 3.x
- webcouturier.dropdownmenu
- Build it out in folder items and use a heirarchy
- Autobuilds via Plone 3 into portal tabs
- Uses INavtreeStrategy
- Uses SitemapQueryBuilder()
- Can change the depth of the navtree via sitemap properties

# Tip 1 - Rounded Corners

- Cornerstone of designer's minds
- pure CSS solution
- Initial nifty corners
- Too ugly XHTML
- No hooks in Plone
- People don't like dealing with CSS if they have to change images
- Images based solutions
- Sliding doors - often used for rounding corners
- Adam Kalsey technique
- Plone has XHTML hooks in portlets for this
- pretty simple css
- Most of the cases use nested HTML elements
- Fixed set of images for the corners
- JS + CSS solution
- The most flexible
- Doesn't require nested elements in HTML
- Does not require additional CSS
- Potential Solutions
- Nifty Corners Cube (Javascript Library
- First doesn not work with borders and background images
- JQuery corners
- Requires jquery and does not work with Safari
- CurvyCorners library (recommended)
- Supports most modern browsers
- Works with borders
- Works with background images
- Supports antialiased corners
- Cons:
- Some problems when background images are used and box has different colors
- Does not work well when used with multiple boxes
- collective.roundedcorners
- On presenter's laptop
- Normal Plone Package/Product
- Uses a mix of Javascript + CSS
- Raw, and will be released hopefully soon
