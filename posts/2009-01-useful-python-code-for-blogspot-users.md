title: Useful python code for blogspot users like me
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/01/useful-python-code-for-blogspot-users.html)_.

The big grief I have with blogspot is that it does not give you an easy way to display code, especially when it comes to XML. Well, that is now accounted for thanks to [a handy script](https://ddavide.blogspot.com/2006/11/convertire-lhtml-in-html-sicuro.html) by the notable [Davide Muzzarelli](https://ddavide.blogspot.com/).

So instead of this (view the source to see the XML instead of just numbers):

```
65
20
300
2400
300
25
50
```

You get this:

&lt;daily-values&gt;
&lt;total-fat units="g"&gt;65&lt;/total-fat&gt;
&lt;saturated-fat units="g"&gt;20&lt;/saturated-fat&gt;
&lt;cholesterol units="mg"&gt;300&lt;/cholesterol&gt;
&lt;sodium units="mg"&gt;2400&lt;/sodium&gt;
&lt;carb units="g"&gt;300&lt;/carb&gt;
&lt;fiber units="g"&gt;25&lt;/fiber&gt;
&lt;protein units="g"&gt;50&lt;/protein&gt;
&lt;/daily-values&gt;

Thank you so much Davide!!!
