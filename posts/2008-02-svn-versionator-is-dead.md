title: SVN Versionator is dead

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/02/svn-versionator-is-dead.html)_.

Before I got a chance to finish this project, a sys admin needed this thing in a pinch and needed the features I hadn't finished. No one else was around so he dissected my code and rewrote it as a shell script. Later I helped him tweak it and now we use it to do our builds.

Oh well. It was fun and got me up to speed on Python's subprocess module.
