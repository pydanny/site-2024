NOTE: there is a bug in the system where, if you change ANYTHING about your registration (except pay for it) after the deadline the price change to the normal reg price instead of the pre-reg price. If this happens, send an e-mail to pycon-reg_at_python_dot_org and someone will help you get the early bird rate.
