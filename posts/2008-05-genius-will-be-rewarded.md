[KF](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/) is a business analyst for NASA.  She is smart.  Too smart for her own good.  For she has gained  the arcane knowledge of the Python Programming Language and dared to write her own lipsum generator.  One serving up snippets of the works of H.P Lovecraft.  I give unto you the Cthulhu Lipsum Generator!

Or not.

I'm not going to be responsible for those who dare to use her tool.

Her mad, mad, mad genius will be reward.  Just not by me!

:o

P.S. If she puts it up on google code I'll link to it and let you use your own judgement.
