title: Need better charting for Python
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/03/need-better-charting-for-python.html)_.

With the release of [Pyglet 1.0](https://www.pyglet.org), I'm hoping that we get better chart support in Python. Yeah, I know that [ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com) does it, but I need prettier charts.

Of course, if I were more adept at manipulating graphics, I would cook this up myself. Thats my excuse and I'm sticking to it!
