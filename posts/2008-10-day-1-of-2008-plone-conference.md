title: Day 1 of the 2008 Plone Conference
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/10/day-1-of-2008-plone-conference.html)*.

The [2008 Plone conference](https://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-conference-2008-dc/project-home) actually started on Wednesday, and Monday and Tuesday were [training days](https://plonebootcamps.com).  I'll be blogging about those later.  Unlike the last conference, set in Italy, this is set here in Washington, DC.  Since I am not being a tourist, I'm doing most of my posts here in my technical blog.

First off, Tuesday I had suffered from my periodic insomnia the night before so this day was a matter of a lot of water, light eating, and trying to keep cool in order to keep myself alert.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Registration</span>

I had volunteered to work the registration desk as part of my effort to contribute to the conference.  I arrived at 7 am.  Others followed shortly and soon enough plonistas began to arrive.  In no special order I got to meet or badge the following people:


- [Ian Bicking](https://blog.ianbicking.org)
- [Martin Aspelli](https://martinaspeli.net)
- [Alexander Limi](https://limi.net)
- [Bradley Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_M._Kuhn)
- [Tres Seaver](https://www.palladion.com/)
- [Nate Aune](https://jazkarta.com)
- [John Stahl](https://blogs.onenw.org/jon/)
- [Most of the KSS team](https://kssproject.org)

   I was not alone as a volunteer for registration!  Also there was:


-     Emma Campbell
-     JoAnna Springsteen
-     Steve?
-     Paul Boos
-     Amy Clark
-     Matt Bowen

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Keynotes</span>

I drifting a little in and out, but mostly I was focused on the registration. I figured I could just catch up on plone.tv.  Not perfectly ideal, but volunteering is good for the soul.  ;)  Then it was off to the talks!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Feed the Masses by Paul Bugni</span>

This was about <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vice</span> a Plone 3.x syndication tool that lets you output types in RSS 2.0, Atom, and even RSS 1.0.  It handles recursions and enclosures and much more.  It looks like a wonderful tool for our efforts, but its not quite yet production ready.  I may spring on it.

I like the Zope Component Architecture approach!  Awesome!

I played timer guy for the nefarious Matt Bowen.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Theming a Plone Site from Start to Finish by Rob Porter</span>

Rob Porter of WebLion presented on material I had just taken a 2 day class on, so in retrospect I should not have gone. On the other hand, I got a few gems and perhaps getting a reinforcement on the class was good. Again I played timer guy for the nefarious Matt Bowen.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Software in the Cloud Speech violates freedom by Bradley Kuhn</span>

Awesome speech!  The cloud is dangerous, because really, who own our emails and twits when we use gmail and twitter?

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Usability by Ginger Butcher and Katie Cunningham</span>

I did not go but visited.  I have to say that I was impressed watching those two for just a few minutes.  They NAILED it.  They talked well, energetically, knew their material, gave good examples, and were having as much fun as two little girls in a sand box.  They did an awesome job and got kudos from Alexander Limi himself.
