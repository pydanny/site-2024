title: Trials and Tribulations of avoiding vi
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/08/trials-and-tribulations-of-avoiding-vi.html)*.

So I'm stuck working today with a Solaris box.  That means no [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs).  Heck, that means even no [nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano_%28text_editor%29)!  Instead all I have is [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi).  Oh no!

Sure, some of you think vi is great.  More power to you.  Its just not something I like to touch, even if I grant automatic respect to anyone who uses it well.  Just like watching any competant craftsman doing their daily tasks, watching a good vi master is pretty fun.

I've been spoiled by Redhat, Ubuntu, and Mac OS X.  They come with Emacs installed, and if you have a few rights, you can add in new text editors.  On Mac OS X I'll use [Textmates](https://www.macromates.com), but otherwise I'll make do with Emacs or even Nano if I must.

If I could have argued successfully for more rights on the Solaris box, and had the rights to download software, I would have gotten Emacs working on that machine.  Alas, the chance of that happening is around the same amount as a presidential political candidate not selling out his morals and ethics.  Which means it ain't happening.

So, my work around?

I had access to the python shell.  I wrote the file in there and saved it to a text file.  Annoying at times, but less painful for me than trying yet again to figure out vi.   I got my stuff done pretty quick and went on to other things.
