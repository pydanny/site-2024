title: More on SVN Versionator
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/01/more-on-svn-versionator.html)_.

Mostly done. Right now it does the copying and updates the version.txt files. It doesn't do the Externals yet, but a coworker has argued that with Buildout we ought to go away from Externals.

Reinout von Rees has his own version that does a couple extra bits like eggifying. I like that very much, and may add a little more.

Alas, work is too busy right now to finish this before our next build. So I'm too busy to make my life easier. Ha ha.
