*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2012/02/working-on-au-sem-mao.html)*.

One of my [resolutions for 2012](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/12/resolutions-for-2012.html) is to perform an [Aú sem Mão/aerial/no handed cartwheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_cartwheel). Ideally, I would be able to do it before [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org), and would perform it during the [Capoeira Open Space](https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/).

Speaking of the Capoeira Open Space, have you [signed up](https://bit.ly/pycon-capoeira) yet to participate? Your skill level or athletic ability doesn't matter, just come and have fun!

<h3>How I'm training</h3>

- Losing enough weight to make jumping easier without losing strength/endurance.
- Practicing a lot of Capoeira. Especially on my non-workout days

Before you say, "do [plyometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics)!", keep in mind that Capoeira already has a lot of similar movements and I've got a tricky ankle. I've done plyometrics before and found that they caused my ankle grief. Capoeira's tight focus on smooth transitions isn't just distinctive, I think it's been good for healing what has been a problem joint for me for the past 9 years.

<h3>How I'm doing</h3>
I'm getting there.

I can do a [butterfly kick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_kick) badly, mostly because I don't arch my back enough. My hope is to get my head down further and my legs up higher. The end result is Aú sem Mão, right?

<h3>Why am I trying to do this?</h3>
Because I haven't done it before. And there is no time like the present. :)
