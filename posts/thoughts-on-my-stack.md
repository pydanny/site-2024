title: Thoughts on my stack
---

I'm an open source developer. I use Python, Django, PostgreSQL, JQuery,
MongoDB, Memcached, and Redis. I push production code to Linux servers.

And yet:

-   My laptop runs Apple's Mac OS X.
-   My primary editor is Sublime Text.
-   My production servers are provided mostly by Heroku.
-   All my sites are hosted on Amazon EC2.

I've got nothing against Apple, Heroku, or Amazon, but their tools are
not open source.

And that's food for thought.
