title: Northern Virginia Django Users Group lives!

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/04/northern-virginia-django-users-group.html)*.

Our acronym is NOVA-DUG.

We have a google group here: [https://groups.google.com/group/NOVA-DUG](https://groups.google.com/group/NOVA-DUG)

Me and my co-worker [Katie Cunningham](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/), are the co-owners of the group. We insist on ownership because we know exactly what we want out of the group.


- It has to meet on a night we can easily attend and that night is invariably Wednesday.
- It has to meet at a location we both can get to easily.

See you around.
