title: Visit the Greater Lipsum Project at your own peril

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/05/visit-greater-lipsum-project-at-your.html)*.

Don't say that I did not warn you, but [kf](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/) has added her [Greater Lipsum](https://code.google.com/p/greaterlipsum/) project to [Google Code](https://code.google.com/).

Now that I've posted this link to an exploit of forbidden knowledge, I can hear the keening of the [Deep Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Ones) all the time.  What once sounding like insane cries of the damned now is starting to sound all too sweet.
