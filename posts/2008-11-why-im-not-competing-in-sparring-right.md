title: Why I'm not competing in sparring right now
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-im-not-competing-in-sparring-right.html)*.

I keep getting asked this question.  I really want to compete in sparring, but various reasons prevent me.  Here is the list:


- I work a full time job that goes more than 40 hours a week sometimes.
- I do side consulting.
- I teach martial arts 10+ hours.
- When we do sparring practice, either I'm tasked with coaching or there is no one who is at my level.

On the last bullet, what I worry most about are hand and arm injuries.  I can't afford to lose the use of what I type with, since that is what covers our mortgage. On the plus side, with the growing size of our adult class, I should be able to find good opponents.
