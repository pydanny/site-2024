title: Best Pycon 2009 Day Ever!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/03/best-pycon-2009-conference-day-ever.html)*.

Yesterday was a day I don't think I will ever be able to top again. I think it was the pinnacle of my geeky existence, and I fear that the rest of my life will be a dull effort to recapture the glory that was yesterday. Why do I think this is so?


- My project, [NASA](https://nasascience.nasa.gov/) SMD Spacebook got mention during [Katie Cunningham](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/)'s lightning talk. 
- I lost one of the [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) [BFDL](https://jacobian.org/)'s dongle And everyone in the worldwide [Python](https://python.org/) [community](https://us.pycon.org/) saw it happen live.
- [Guido van Rossum](https://www.python.org/~guido/) talked about [twitter](https://twitter.com/) in his keynote. He referred to a [twit post](https://twitter.com/bshaurette/status/1403884536) which was [Barbara Shaurrette](https://www.djangrrl.com/) helping me get a chance to gush at him like a screaming fan boy. So yes, Guido is aware that I exist!
- NASA SMD Spacebook got multiple mentions in the [Pinax](https://pinaxproject.com/) talk by [James Tauber](https://jtauber.com/).
- In [Ian Bicking](https://blog.ianbicking.org/)'s infamous pycon 2009 talk I managed to misspell [Whiskey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey)/[Whisky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky) twice! Once the Old Country way and once the New World way.
- I got a 3 minute opportunity to gush like a raving fan boy to Guido before he managed to escape.
- [Zed Shaw](https://zedshaw.com/) kicked me in the nuts!

That said, in the hopes that I can top this magnificent effort, I am calling this post the 'Best Pycon 2009 Conference Day'. My hope is that maybe I can beat it in the future. I doubt it. Sob.

<b>Update:</b> I beat this day the next year when I met Audrey Roy.
