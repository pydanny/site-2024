All things are prepaid or reserved now. I have to pack and make sure I've got my shifts at the gym covered. And maybe ask people for advice on what to do with my little bit of free time there.

I'm wondering if my hotel, the DoubleTree near O'Hare airport has a laundry facility. That would make life so very much easier.
