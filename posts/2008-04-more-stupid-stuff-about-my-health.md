title: More stupid stuff about my health
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/04/more-stupid-stuff-about-my-health.html)*.

Over the weekend I took it easy.  Not by choice.  My energy levels are just plain low thanks to this stupid health issue.  My muscles all feel fatigued.  Sometimes the area that hurt before aches.  I've got a painkiller in case it gets bad.  I haven't taken it yet cause it might make me dizzy.

The real concern for me is this weekend.  I really, really want to get away.  I'll have 10 hours with my work buddy James to work on a side project while we travel.  I'll meet my cousin who I haven't seen in about 10-20 years.  I might get to see other NYC people I know.

Thats it.  You know about as much as I do.
