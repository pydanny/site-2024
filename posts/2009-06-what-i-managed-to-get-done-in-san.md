title: What I managed to get done in San Francisco
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2009/06/what-i-managed-to-get-done-in-san.html)*.

1. <s>Visit my friend Daryl Spitzer in Palo Alto for lunch at VMWare.</s>

Wednesday, June 3rd I ate dinner at Pluto's in Palo Alto with [Daryl Spitzer](https://yacitus.com/) and Zain Memon. It was good catching up!

2. <s>Rent a bike at fisherman's wharf and go mountain biking on the trails of Angel island in the bay.</s>

Thursday, June 4th me and Zain cycled Perimeter Road on Angel Island on rented bikes (get the rentals on the island since they don't ask for a hefty down payment). The views were incredible.

3. <s>Rent a bike at fisherman's wharf and go road biking through the hills of the Marin Headlands.</s>

Well, actually I did not do this, but instead on Tuesday, June 2nd I bike the Golden gate bridge, through Sausalito, up to Old Mill park, through Tiburon, and up into Belvedere (which has a monster hill that pushed me to my limits).

4. <s>Spend some time at Fisherman's wharf since I'll be there for the bikes anyway.</s>

Best seafood place there by far is Nick's, a hole in the wall where the cook is on the sidewalk. Ignore the pricey tourist traps and go to Nick's!

5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Go to the Exploratorium</span>

Fail!

6. <span style="font-style: italic;">Go to the SFMOMA</span>

Fail!

7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rent a cheap hotel room somewhere and then wake up at dawn to watch the sun rise over Golden Gate or something.</span>

Fail!

8. <s>See Alcatraz.</s>

Went with [Barbara Shaurette](https://www.djangrrl.com/) on Sunday, June 7th. I was tired from walking around San Francisco for many awesome hours the day before, but it was worth it.

9. <span style="font-style: italic;">See giant trees in Muir Forest.</span>

Fail! But I did see some pretty decent sized trees in Old Mill Park.
