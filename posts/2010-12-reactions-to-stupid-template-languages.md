title: Reactions to "Stupid Template Languages"

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/12/reactions-to-stupid-template-languages.html)*.

My blog post on [Stupid Template Languages](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/12/stupid-template-languages.html)&nbsp;has had some excellently crafted responses by&nbsp;[Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/about/),&nbsp;[Mike Baye](https://techspot.zzzeek.org/)r, and&nbsp;[Steve Holden](https://holdenweb.blogspot.com/).&nbsp;I respect and admire each of these developers, and their combined projects have made a real impact on my career. I'm happy that our community is large enough to have a difference of opinion, delighted that our base language of [Python](https://python.org/) allows us the power to play with different options so easily, and hope that we can debate our differences of opinion this year at [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/). The first round of drinks are on me!
