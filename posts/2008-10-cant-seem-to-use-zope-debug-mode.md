title: Can't seem to use zope debug mode anymore.

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/10/cant-seem-to-use-zope-debug-mode.html)_.

I drop out very quickly from my Mac OS X laptop running 10.5. Going to go home and try it on Ubuntu. Grrr... this is a royal pain.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: This was because I had a broken version of readline on my Mac. I did sudo easy_install readline and now it works.
