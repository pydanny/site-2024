title: I grok viewlets in Plone 3
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/02/i-grok-viewlets-in-plone-3.html)*.

Thanks to Martin Aspelli's handy book and some notes I found via Googling and my own Zope 3 experience, I started to find success with viewlets.  I need to read Mikko's nasty jibe on the subject and see if I still am in his corner.  My impression is powerful, but admittedly hard to tweak without tiny issues that take annoying time to fix.
