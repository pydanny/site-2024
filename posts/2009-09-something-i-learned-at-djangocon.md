That is me in the blue shirt doing [Capoeira](https://www.vimeo.com/6802099)! The other videos aren't as good as this one. Of course, in general I look pretty sloppy - something I will have to fix!

I found what might be a pretty good place in DC for doing Capoeira, the aptly named [Capoeira DC](https://www.capoeiradc.com). I'm really thinking of getting into this, at least on Saturday afternoons.

[Django](https://djangoproject.com) brought me to Capoeira. Another reason for the world to use Django!
