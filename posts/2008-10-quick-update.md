For those who care, here is what is in the Danny news:


- Bought the kid a nice bike as an early birthday present.  Money came from his grandparents and us for the bike, and its much better than what I have.  Now he easily outpaces me.  I am very jealous!
- Jen is off to Calgary over Halloween.
- Saturday I compete in forms for the first time.  I'll be doing Koryo, and if I can land the side kicks then I'm certain to win.
- Shaved my head.  So far at work for 90 minutes no one has noticed.
