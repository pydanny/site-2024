title: Join the PyCon Early Birds program!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2012/01/join-pycon-early-birds-program.html)*.

First off, I want to say that me and my [fiancee](https://twitter.com/audreyr) will be attending [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2012/) this year! Hooray! Can't wait to see old friends and make new ones. I'll be chairing one of the Panels at the PyWeb Summit on March 8th. We're absolutely delighted to see all the great talks, hang out in the hallway, and just be in the middle of Python for well over a week. 

Now on to the <strong>extremely unofficial PyCon Early Birds</strong> program!

PyCon early registration ends on January 25th. If you [register](https://us.pycon.org/2012/registration/) at the early bird rate that gets you the benefit of joining the elite PyCon Early Birds group. Being a member of the <strong>PyCon Early Birds</strong> gets you all sorts of incredible rewards and benefits.


- Most importantly, you get some serious bragging rights.
- A custom ribbon that says '<strong>Early Bird</strong>' that you get to attach to your conference badge.
- A discounted rate from the regular ticket rate as according to the [registration](https://us.pycon.org/2012/registration/) page.
- The confidence of knowing you have a ticket before they sell out.
- A tasty and rather edible store-bought cookie provided by myself and Audrey Roy.
- If the <strong>PyCon Early Birds</strong> program gets enough members, I'm going to challenge PyCon chair Jesse Noller to stump me with Yoga poses! There's no way he'll even consider accepting a challenge like this unless the <strong>PyCon Early Birds</strong> membership roster is big enough. So join and help me find out if his [Bikram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikram_Yoga) will beat my [Capoeira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira)!
- Other incredible things that are in the works!


Of course, PyCon has tons of other reasons to sign up besides the <strong>PyCon Early Birds</strong> program. Amazing [tutorials](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/tutorials/), [talks](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/), and [sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2012/commmunity/sprints/projects/), plus great hallway tracks, a vendor room filled with great schwag, poster sessions, and startup row. [Sponsorship](https://us.pycon.org/2012/sponsors/) levels are unbelievably high, and since the event is non-profit that means the money just goes right back into the community - starting with PyCon itself. This year is going to be <strong>AWESOME</strong>!!!

So what are you waiting for? [Sign up](https://us.pycon.org/2012/registration/) for the <strong>Pycon Early Birds</strong> before it's too late!

Might I suggest cookies right down the street from https://www.specialtys.com/ProductGallery.aspx?RootMenuId=142&amp;MenuId=148&amp;MenuDisplayOption=5

Those sound AWESOME. I was thinking double-stuffed oreos, but if business is good maybe I'll change my mind. ;)

I'm registered! Now somebody said something about cookies?

Caveat: these things are sooo big, they can be a meal. They're also fatty and very bad for you. Not only are they to die for, but they will accelerate your doom. Anyway, the closest location would be at 3399 Bowers Ave, Santa Clara, CA, 95054. :-)

Mike, part of how I transitioned from feeling like a noob to being the eager student I am today is via PyCon. It is amazingly good for beginners. Not just the tutorials, but the sessions are wonderful. The sprints are really good for honing your skills too.
