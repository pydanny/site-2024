*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/09/see-you-at-djangocon.html)*.

I'm off to the Pacific Northwest, specifically [Portland, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Oregon) for [DjangoCon](https://djangocon.org/). I'll be presenting a tutorial with [James Tauber](https://jtauber.com/) and participating in two panels. This sort of event is always a lot of work, study, and networking. I won't have much time to go sightseeing because this is a working trip, but I'm sure to squeeze in a little bit.

Portland is a very green city, has great food, and is famous for cycling. I'm sure I can find something to do!

Thanks to everyone who had a hand in me getting there or is holding down the fort back home. The quick list would be in alphabetical order:


- [Chris Adams](https://improbable.org/chris)
- Corin Turner
- Dave Sanchez
- Jim Consalvi

- [Katie Cunningham](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/)
- Katie Wilcox

- Mom
- [Robert Lofthouse](https://djangopeople.net/siudesign/)
- Ron Boykin
- Ruth Netting 

Thanks everyone!
