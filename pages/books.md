Writing is a passion of mine. Here are my published books. Most are co-authored with my wife, Audrey.

## Technical

With Audrey, I have co-authored a number of dairy-themed technical books.

### Two Scoops of Django 3.x

The 5th edition of Two Scoops of Django supports Django 3.x, but contains material still relevant for Django 4 and 5. With over 500 pages of material, you'll find best practices that will improve all your Django projects.

## Fiction

I also write fiction, also mostly with Audrey. Dairy isn't mentioned in any of them.
