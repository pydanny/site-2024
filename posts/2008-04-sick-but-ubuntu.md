title: Sick but Ubuntu
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/04/sick-but-ubuntu.html)_.

I was out of work for a couple days. Stuck at home, the first evening I grabbed an old machine and installed Ubuntu plus a surplus wireless card. This was my second Ubuntu install, the first suffering from a Microsoft wireless card. I was amazed by how fast and easy the install was to do. I kept the old XP on a seperate partition and got on the house network in 30 minutes.

Of course the basic installation doesn't have all the python tools I like to use. That took me another 30 minutes.

The only real downside I discovered was a lack of Mac's Textmate. I can do emacs, but Textmate is my preference. So I toyed a bit with gEdit and was pleased. Its also free!

One thing that Ubuntu beats out Mac and Windoze for is speed. Granted, this is a new install but I have to say I love the speed of the machine. And this machine is about 3.5 years old.

Good times indeed.
