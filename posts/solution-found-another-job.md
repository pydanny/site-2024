There's nothing like a good rant to clean out the sinuses. And in this case, I'm ranting about bosses I've had during my 25+ year programming career.

## Not a Good Mentor Boss

Early on in my software career I was hired by a nice senior engineer who taught me a lot. They left the company and I was transferred over to the "Not a Good Mentor Boss".

The "Not a Good Mentor Boss" just didn't have it in them to level up a junior engineer. When I would need help, they would get frustrated quickly. Eventually I stopped asking questions and started to make larger and larger mistakes out of ignorance. They got angrier over time as my mistakes compounded. So I wouldn't ask so many questions.

Yes, I was in a negative feedback loop.

Solution: Found another job.

## Golf Player

Our boss was a rather stupid junior developer who would vanish early on Wednesday and Friday afternoons. We found out where he was going when the CEO announced he was taking over as architect over the tech team, that they cemented the role change on the golf course,

Solution: Found another job.

> "I know person X intentionally sabotaged your project but they're my friend. You're just going to have to live with it."

Enough complaints emerged about this boss that the program director mandated our boss was not allowed to interact with us, this person's own team. That worked for three months and then a new program director came onboard. First thing they did was "bring the old team back together."

Solution: Found another job.

## Doesn't lead by example + abuse

> "You're going to have to work over the holiday season, and that includes the weekends. Anyway, I'm off to Tahoe. See ya later!"

I worked non-stop for six weeks. Got really sick but came to work 7 days a week. Never got any recognition for my labor.

Solution: Found another job.

Note: Never did anything like that again.
