title: Start of the Conference

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/10/start-of-conferenc.html)*.

I had trouble sleeping unday, so I too two benedryl to get to sleep.  That made me blurry in the morning but sleep is something I need in order to focus.  Breakfast was a handful of grapes.

The conference is taking place at the Ronald Reagan building, so I took the Orange line train from East Falls Church to Federal Triangle.  Then I wandered the RR building for 10 minutes trying to find my class.  Came in, saw my buddy Vern Chapman from the bootcamp this summer, sat down, and got ready.

The class I'm taking is Plone theming.  It was well taught but most of the first day is just review stuff for me.  I learned a couple new things, but nothing super-critical.

I did spend a good 15 minutes talking productively with Amy Clark, the better half of [aclark.net](https://aclark.net/).

I was thinking about going to the gym tonight to work out, but people are going to an Ethiopian restaurant this evening and it might behoove me to do that instead of staying fit.  We'll see how I feel in a couple of hours.
