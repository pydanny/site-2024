title: Prayers to Jessica and family

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2008/08/prayers-to-jessica-and-family.html)*.

My last gaming convention was DragonCon 2004.  The con was fun, but the important thing was meeting a pair of New Yorkers, Jessica and Chris.

Jess is unbelievable.  Depending on your inclinations you wish you were her or dated her.  Smart like a whip, compassionate, attractive, and very into her Jewish roots.  She can quote Hebrew poetry, discuss the nuances of fine literature, teach classes at the collegiate level, play video games, play tabletop games, look good in a bodice, and has a wicked sense of humor to boot.  For us geeks, she worked for [Clay Shirky](https://www.shirky.com/)! If there is anything not to like about Jess is that I know she watches at least Japanese horror movies.

Chris is her boyfriend of a decade or so, and keeps up with her in what seems every regard (except the horror movies).  In a more savage world he would be challenged to sword fights for the right to court Jess.

These are good people.  Trust me.

Jess has shared at least once that her father is important, and holds him in respect.  She described him recently by comparing herself this:
<blockquote>For those of you who have met my father, or heard my stories about him, you have some idea of what an amazing guy he is. For those of you who don't know him, our family jokes that I am his clone - so if you know me, you do know him, a little bit. He is my hero, my role model, my compass and my guide. I am hoping and praying for his recovery so that I have a chance to share the next thirty years with him.</blockquote>If  he is even a little like this, then her father must be quite the gentleman.  He should move down here because we need more smart people to run the country.

Anyway, on Friday, August 22, 2008, Jess' father had a serious accident.  He is in the ICU up in Boston.  I've extended my prayers and hopes to them that he recovers quickly.
