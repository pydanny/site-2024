title: NOVA-DUG meetup for Wed, April 29th
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/04/nova-dug-meetup-for-wed-april-29th.html)*.

We are planning to get together on Wednesday, April 29th, 2009, at 7:30pm EST most likely at the Ballston Commons mall in Arlington, VA. We know this is the day right before Django District, but since Euro DjangoCon is the next week, and we want 'host' a DC area sprint during the Euro DjangoCon sprints on May 7th and May 8th, we felt it was important to get another meeting off the ground.

Ballston Commons Mall Panera (ignore google maps and just go into the front entrance of the Mall)
