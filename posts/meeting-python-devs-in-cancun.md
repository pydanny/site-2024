title: Meeting Python Devs in Cancun
---

On Saturday, October 26th Audrey, Uma, and I had the pleasure of attending the second session of [PyCun](https://www.meetup.com/Py-Cun/), the [Cancun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc%C3%BAn) Python user group. They are fans of our [books](/pages/books) and in turn we were impressed by the talk given by [Oscar Ortega](https://github.com/oortega) on Django, Celery, and polling for updates using jQuery.

It was amazing to meet other engineers and developers in such a lovely beach town.
