title: Finally, good food!

Ate at a place a mile's walk from the conference center. It served Chicago stle pizza, complete with cornbread dusted place. It was packed full of Chicago folks and when we got served we found why.

Good sauce on top, decent quality cheese, and the crust just plain tasted right. On the veggie pizza I ate around the onions since those had over-cooked. But the brocolli was perfect. The sausage/spinach pizza had the normal sort of bland pepperoni but the sausage was real good.

It ended up being about $15 a person, roughly comparable to a pizza meal in Naples, Italy.

They also offered Pizza Beer there, flavored with basil and other things, but none of us had the nerve to try it.
