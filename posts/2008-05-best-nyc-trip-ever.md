title: Best NYC trip ever!

This weekend I went up to NYC with a co-worker (JSR) to enjoy the famous 5 Boros Ride.  We stayed with my family, specifically my mother's cousin and her husband, Roxanne and Michael.  And all of it was great.

Our hosts were wonderful.  They made very certain we knew how to get there, and even me with my bad sense of direction felt I could navigate there if needed.  Their condo in Harlem was light and airy, large but cozy.  Roxanne made an incredible lasagna for dinner the night before, which has spoiled me for life.  More family came to share dinner, including their grown daughter Rose (who seems to have inherited all of the positive Aaron traits and none of the negative ones), her sister Diana and her husband Aria, and their adolescent daughter Jordana.  It was Rose' birthday so we indulged in her ice cream cake.

The ride itself deserves its own post.  Lets just say it was wonderful.   More to come...
