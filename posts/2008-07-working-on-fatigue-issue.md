title: Working on the fatigue issue

So on tuesday I talked to a doctor who trains with us at the gym.  When we talked the whole thing about electrolytes, and I said I thought I was getting enough, he suggested I really up my intake of potassium, calcium, and even sodium.  As he put it, '<span style="font-style: italic;">putting salt on your food might be bad for most people, but with your volume of physical effort 5 - 6 days a week, it might be what you need to do</span>.'

Now I haven't put any salt on my food yet.  But I am drinking more electrolyte water.  Eating more bananas and looking to buy some more suppliments.  I think I feel better but it might be too early to tell.

The other thing he mentioned is that with my kidney issue I might just be anemic.  He said that if upping the body salts doesn't work to try upping my iron intake. 

He also said I might want to go to the doctor.
