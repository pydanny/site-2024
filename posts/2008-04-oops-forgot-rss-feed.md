title: Oops... forgot RSS feed
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/04/oops-forgot-rss-feed.html)_.

Its not a big thing cause adding RSS feeds to Plone is painfully easy. Nevertheless, it is amusing how [NASA Science](https://science.nasa.giv) didn't have RSS feeds listed on the front page on launch.

I think atom feeds are also planned.
