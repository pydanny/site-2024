title: Slides from DjangoCon 2009

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/09/slides-from-djangocon-2009.html)*.

James Tauber and I presented a tutorial at [DjangoCon](https://djangocon.org). The presentation well until a gaff near the end. We are changing things a bit and presenting this again at [Pycon](https://us.pycon.org/2010/) (if we are accepted). My slides are up!

Bonus points to anyone who identifies the mistakes in the slides.
