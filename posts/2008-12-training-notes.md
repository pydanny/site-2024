- Fixed my diet. No more junk food or snacks!

- Next week I start my weight lifting regimen in earnest.
- Side kicks looking sharper.
- Round kicks at face level with power.
- Really working to launch all kicks from the balls of my feet.
- Need to get light gloves for bag work. Can't afford sore hands during my day job.
- Six months from about right now!
