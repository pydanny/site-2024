title: Quitting Caffeine Fail
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/07/quitting-caffeine-fail.html)*.

In the crazy heady days of May two months ago I [decided to quit consuming caffeine](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2009/05/quitting-caffeine.html).

I cut out coffee, soda, and black tea. It was surprisingly easy. Hooray!

So I happily went along drinking herbal teas like chamomile, cinnamon-orange, peach, and of course, green tea. Life was great! I was getting my anti-oxidants and none of the bad stuff. I could hang with my co-worker [Katie](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/) and be one of those 'cool non-caffeine drinkers'.

So one day weeks ago I mention to Katie at some point that I was going to make some green tea and offered her some. She said she couldn't have it because of the caffeine, then she blinked.

Which means she just figured something out.  Then she declared:

<span style="font-weight: bold;">OH MY GOD YOU HAD NO IDEA GREEN TEA HAD CAFFEINE!</span>!!

That was followed by a bit more of mockery.

So yeah, I failed to quit drinking caffeine then. However, today, while I'm home being sick, I'm trying to quit again. Wish me luck.

The &quot;caffeine&quot; from tea and the one from coffee are not the same.

For starters, green tea only has half the caffeine of a can of Coke. 
Also, the theanine (an amino acid commonly found in tea) counteract the rise in blood pressure that normally happens with caffeine intake.

@jaun,

Um... caffeine from tea and caffeine from coffee is the same substance. 
Just because one provides less caffeine than the other or has other beneficial effects doesn't change that face.

Oops, that was supposed to end with '<b>fact</b>', not '<b>face</b>'.
