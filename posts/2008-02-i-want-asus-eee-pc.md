title: I want an Asus eee pc

I think the 4 GB version would be nice. I would probably replace Xandros Linux with Xubuntu because then I could work with more packages. My reasons:

- I need a second machine for consulting work.- It sucks when I want to go somewhere and I have to lug nearly seven pounds of hardware in my backback, not to mention power supply and various other accessories. I bicycle and when people talk about speed increases when they dump just 1 pound it makes me wonder how much easier it would be with a nice light machine.
- My production machines I touch now are Linux, so this means implementations are closer to the final development.
- I want some hacker creds.

Its gonna be a while, I'm just being hopeful.
