title: How to Read Kindle Books Without a Kindle Device
---

Like any author, as soon as I released my first fiction book on Amazon through Kindle Select, I excitedly informed everyone I knew.

Unfortunately, many friends and family informed me that they didn't have Kindles. They asked if there was any way they could read it without a Kindle.

Here's the deal. You don't need a Kindle to read it. All you need is the Kindle app for your smartphone or tablet, or Kindle software for your computer.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lyGJbe_8tlg/VS6kp10P2MI/AAAAAAAAEz8/1-mfFBYv-lI/s1600/kindle-app-on-samsung-phone-annotated.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lyGJbe_8tlg/VS6kp10P2MI/AAAAAAAAEz8/1-mfFBYv-lI/s320/kindle-app-on-samsung-phone-annotated.png" width="480" /></a></div>
Just click on the link below for your particular device to download the appropriate free Kindle app:


- [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle-read-books-ebooks-magazines/id302584613)
- [iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle-read-books-ebooks-magazines/id302584613)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle)
- [Mac OS X](https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/mac/download)
- [Windows](https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download)
- [Firefox Phone](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=155915197084092577)
- [Blackberry](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/25058915/)

Or, if you have Chrome, Firefox or Safari installed, use [Kindle Cloud Reader](https://read.amazon.com/) to read Kindle books without having to install any new software.

Once you have a Kindle app installed, you get access to the Kindle store. Then just search for my name, and the book will come up.

Enjoy!

In the future I hope to release it on other platforms besides Kindle, but for now I'm locked in due to the terms of the Kindle Select Program.
