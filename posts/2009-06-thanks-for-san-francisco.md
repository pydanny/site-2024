title: Thanks for San Francisco!

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2009/06/thanks-for-san-francisco.html)*.

I was in San Francisco on vacation the first week in June. I had a great, wonderful time, and I owe that to my friends and my mom. They are all wonderful people, and I want to reach out to each of them. So in alphabetical order:

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Barbara </span>[https://djangrrl.com](https://djangrrl.com/)

I met her not long before pycon 2009 via the [Pinax](https://pinaxproject.com/) community. She is a very talented developer, Barbara has the 'luxury' of working in the music industry. She's got mad [php](https://php.org/), [mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/), [python](https://python.org/), and of course, [django](https://djangoproject.com/) skills.

For the trip she found us (me, Noah, Zain) tickets to [Spamalot](https://www.montypythonsspamalot.com/), got us (me, Noah, Zain) into the DNALounge for a Zombie Beach party, gave me a walking tour of San Francisco, introduced me to really @#$%ing great vegan food, and took me to Alcatraz. Her knowledge of how to get around San Francisco is unmatched. The last day as we parted ways she tried to get me to go to more places on my own, but I was wiped out from her boundless energy.

Thank you Barbara!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dave B [https://davidbrenneman.com/](https://davidbrenneman.com/)</span>

Dave is like me, living in both the [plone](https://plone.org/) and django communities. He has done some really fascinating work in both areas. He is bright and smart.

I met Dave Friday night for dinner at a really good sushi place whose name I wish I could remember. We challenged the sushi chef to pick what we would eat since he would have to impress us. The result was a number of subtle but delicious selections. Afterwards we went to his place across the Golden Gate park panhandle and I got to meet his lovely wife. They are expecting their first this year!

Thank you Dave!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dave S. and Cecille P.</span>

A couple of my DC area friends, they both encouraged me to go on a vacation. They've been great to me this past couple of months. I'll always remember their kindness!

Thanks Dave and Cecille!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Daryl [https://yacitus.blogspot.com](https://yacitus.blogspot.com/)</span>

I met Daryl at pycon 2008. He's a Canadian but don't hold that against him. He works for [vmware](https://vmware.com/) in Palo Alto. His python and django skills are crazy good.

Daryl was busy the whole time but put a lot of work into finding things for me to see and do around the bay, since most of the time I was solo. He did hang with me for a bit on Wednesday (June 3, 2009) night and we had dinner at [Pluto](https://plutosfreshfood.com/)'s. That place is like Chipotle on steroids. Next time I hope to visit his house and let his kids hit me with sticks or something else fun.

Thanks Daryl!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Katie [https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/)</span>

My co-worker and our group's technical lead. Multi-talented, besides herding us cats... err... developers... she can code in php, python, draw, and write.

Katie kept the home fires burning at work. Or rather, she kept the fires from raging out of control and consuming the universe.

Thanks Katie!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">My Mom</span>

She used to work for a very scary government agency with three letters and retired at the level of 'bigtime boss lady'. Now she does lots of volunteer work, gardening, and many exercise classes.

Mom made sure I got to San Francisco in ways only a parent can. She also encouraged me to take pictures with me in them, and has happily listened to many of my stories about the trip.

Thanks Mom!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Zain</span>
Last but definately not least is Zain. I met Zain at pycon 2009 in the midst of the [infamous Django/Pinax fued](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ubernostrum/3400218057). Zain is one of the those annoyingly bright young guys with a wonderful personality. Amongst other things he is doing [Google Summer of Code](https://code.google.com/soc/) for django core, working to augment the Admin UI.

Zed literally hosted me at his house in San Jose. He fed me, clothed me, washed my clothes, and took a day off from work to go cycling with me around Angel Island. He drives through the hills like a maniac too.

I can't thank Zain enough!
