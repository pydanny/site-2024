Before Plone 3 these were called Smart Folders.  Now we call them Collections.  Since this project is Plone 2.5.4, I guess these are called Smart Folders.

So what I'm doing is extending it to include a few extra fields.  Its for a last gasp requirement change. Making the content module was not much work.  Making easily removable view changes across 10 odd views has been a bit more work.  But I think I'm done.

Anyway, it was easy to do.
