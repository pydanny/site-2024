title: Python Tips ahoy!
---

_This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2007/09/python-tips-ahoy.html)_.

On the eve of Talk Like a Pirate Day, I am announcing a new personal project. A little site I'm going to call pytips, Python Tips, Yellow Monkey Land, or maybe something else. Its going to serve up recipes and tips for Python, and eventually other languages as well.

So why am I doing this?

Four reasons:

1. I think the Python community could be well served by such a site.
2. I want to practice in another framework besides Zope and Plone.
3. I need to keep my relational database skills from getting rusty.
4. Sounds like fun!

I'm going to do this in Pylons. I thought about Django, and maybe I'll make a port of it at some point. Shouldn't be too hard, right?
