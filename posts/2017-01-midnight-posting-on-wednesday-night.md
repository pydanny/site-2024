title: Midnight Posting on Wednesday Night
---

Here on the west coast of the United States, It's just after midnight on Wednesday. That means I can publish chapter 12 of Siege!

You might wonder how I keep up this pace of three chapters a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). Well, I can do that because I'm anywhere from six to eight chapters ahead. So far Siege has been a blast to write, and the words just keep pouring out. 

Thank you, everyone, who has read it so far, especially those of you who have given such excellent commentary.  Your input is greatly appreciated. :-)
