title: NOVA-DUG meeting on Wednesday, April 15th, at 7:30 pm

The Northern Virginia Django Users Group[ NOVA-DUG](https://groups.google.com/group/NOVA-DUG) plans to get together for the first time on Wednesday, April 15th, 2009, at 7:30 PM somewhere in Arlington, Virginia. Everyone is invited, although my bet is that only people from the Washington, DC metropolitan area will show up.

Location?

We are working on that. If we can't find a decent sized meeting room to host us, we will likely converge at Panera Bread in Clarendon. It is close to the Clarendon orange line metro stop, has eatable food for dinner, and has free wireless that works with every operating system AFAIK. If a lot of people show up, we may not be able to all sit together, but we'll make sure that everyone gets to meet everyone else.

Why the rush?

Because the inertia is there.

Because we (myself, [Katie Cunningham](https://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/)) have waited across languages for years for a user group to meet on a night and location that works for us.

See you there!
