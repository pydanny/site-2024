title: I want to talk to Jython and Iron Python developers
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/07/i-want-to-talk-to-jython-and-iron.html)*.

I want to ask some questions of the [Jython](www.jython.org/) and [Iron Python](https://ironpython.net/) communities. I'm primarily looking for efforts that can go into publishable case studies. Experience in use of [Django](https://djangoproject.com) in the Jython and Iron Python environments is also very much desired. Please use my email address which is obfuscated below and can be decoded by simply running the code in a python shell:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">''.join([chr(x) for x in [112, 121, 100, 97, 110, 110, 121, 64, 103, 109, 97, 105, 108, 46, 99, 111, 109]])</pre>
