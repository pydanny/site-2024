*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2008/10/feedfeeder-2-plan.html)*.

I started working on it last week.  Basically the outline of who things will be set up, and our goals.  Meant to finish it up and actually start coding on Sunday but then spent a good chunk of the day working on the house, raking leaves, and cycling. 

Sometimes I wish I could be one of the guys who can code from wake up to bed time.  :P
