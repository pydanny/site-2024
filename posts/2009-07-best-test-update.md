title: Belt test update

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/2009/07/best-test-update.html)*.

First off, I'm getting off being rather sick for nearly a week. My endurance is shot, I've lost some strength,  and I didn't get the chance to fine tune some of the techniques. Unlike some places, our high level tests are grueling and hard. So I have serious concerns about testing at this time. Therefore, <span style="font-weight: bold;">I reserve the right to not test, and will probably make the call Thursday night.</span>

Second, the time for the start of the test (if I go forward with it) is 6pm. Again, seating is limited so either come a little early or bring your own chair. Senior citizens do get preference, but if there are a lot of senior citizens...

Time: 6:00 pm
Location: 6408 Williamsburg, Blvd, Arlington, VA 22207
