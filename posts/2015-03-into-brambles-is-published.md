title: Into the Brambles is Published!
---

After a year of writing and four months of thorough revision, I'm excited to announce that my first fiction book is now out!

As of today, it's available [in Kindle format on Amazon](https://mybook.to/itb). The name of the book is <i>Into the Brambles</i>. It's the first book of what will be a longer <i>The Brambles</i> fantasy epic.

<i>The world was ancient, scarred from a thousand wars between gods, immortals, and heroes. Old grudges have faded but are not forgotten.

At the end of a so-called ‘age of peace’, two great nations of immortals march against each other, with humanity caught in the middle. In this world of conflict, three very different individuals are thrust into the face of danger.

Here a young man is marched off to war, a noble woman takes charge of her own destiny, and in the depths of the Haunted Lands a dark king is born. Their fates will shake the foundations of the universe.</i>

In the book, I explore three primary characters. Like us, they are victims of circumstance. What they make of those circumstances affects not just themselves but the world around them. In other words, they make decisions and act on them. Unfortunately, good intentions and casual cruelty are both recipes for making bad decisions.

Even though I began putting pen to parchment (or keyboard to file) a year and a half ago, elements of the story have been brewing in my head for much longer. Writing the book involved a New Year's Resolution, the encouragement and editing of my wife, family, and friends, plus a lot of coffee.

If you would like to buy my book, you can do so on [Amazon](https://mybook.to/itb) for the introductory price of $2.99, the same price as a cup of coffee. The book is also in the Kindle Unlimited program, at least for now.
